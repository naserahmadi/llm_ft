It is a price-weighted index comprised of Japan's top 225 blue-chip companies traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange . The Nikkei is equivalent to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index in the United States. [PAR] BREAKING DOWN 'Nikkei' [PAR] Originally called the Nikkei Dow Jones Stock Average (from 1975 to 1985), it is now named for the \"Nihon Keizai Shimbun\" or Japan Economic Newspaper, commonly known as Nikkei, which sponsors the calculation of the index. The index has been calculated since September 1950, retroactive to May 1949. Among the best-known companies included in the Nikkei index are Canon Inc., Sony Corporation and Toyota Motor Corporation. It is the oldest stock index in Asia. [PAR] The Nikkei was established as part of the rebuilding and industrialization of Japan in the aftermath of the Second World War. Constituent stocks are ranked by share price, rather than by market capitalization as is common in most indexes. Valuations are denominated in Japanese yen. The composition of the Nikkei is reviewed every September, and any needed changes take place in October. [PAR] Background [PAR] The Tokyo Stock Exchange was established in 1878. In 1943, during the Second World War, the Japanese government combined the TSE with five others to form a single Japanese Stock Exchange. That exchange was closed down in August 1945, near the end of the war. The Tokyo Stock Exchange re-opened on May 16, 1949 under the aegis of the new Securities Exchange Act . [PAR] Japan experienced a major asset bubble in the late 1980's, as the government used fiscal and monetary stimuli to counteract a recession caused by the Japanese yen's 50% appreciation during the first part of the decade. Stock prices and land values tripled between 1985 and 1989; at the height of the bubble, the TSE accounted for 60% of global stock market capitalization. The bubble burst in 1990, and the value of the Nikkei Index fell by one-third that year. In October 2008, the Nikkei traded below 7,000; this was a decline of more than 80% from its December 1989 high. It subsequently rebounded strongly, rising 150% between June 2012 and June 2015 with the help of economic stimulus from the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan . This was still nearly 50% below the 1989 high. [PAR] Investing in the Nikkei Index [PAR] It is not possible to directly purchase an index, but there are several Exchange Traded Funds whose components correlate to the Nikkei. ETFs that track it and trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange include Blackrock Japan's iShares Nikkei 225 and Nomura Asset Management 's Nikkei 225 Exchange Traded Fund. The MAXIS Nikkei 225 Index ETF is a dollar-denominated fund that trades on the New York Stock Exchange .

A natural-born class clown, he was voted the most popular student at Roosevelt Junior and Senior High. By the age of 15, he was doing standup gigs at 25 to 50 dollars a pop, and within a few years he was headlining on the comedy-club circuit. [PAR] Murphy was 19 he was when hired as one of the backup performers on the NBC comedy weekly Saturday Night Live. His unique blend of youthful arrogance, sharkish good cheer, underlying rage, and street-smart versatility transformed the comedian into SNL's prime attraction, and soon the country was reverberating with imitations of such choice Murphy characterizations as sourball celebrity Gumby, inner-city kiddie host Mr. Robinson, prison poet Tyrone Green, and the Little Rascals' Buckwheat. Just when it seemed that he couldn't get any more popular, Murphy was hastily added to the cast of Walter Hill's 1982 comedy/melodrama feature film 48 Hours, and voila, an eight-million-dollars-per-picture movie star was born. The actor followed this cinematic triumph with John Landis' Trading Places, a Prince and the Pauper update released during the summer of 1983, the same year that the standup album Eddie Murphy, Comedian won a Grammy. In 1984, he finally had the chance to carry a picture himself: Beverly Hills Cop, one of the most successful pictures of the decade. Proving that at this juncture Murphy could do no wrong, his next starring vehicle, The Golden Child (1986), made a fortune at the box office, despite the fact that the picture itself was less than perfect. After Beverly Hills Cop 2 and his live standup video Eddie Murphy Raw (both 1987), Murphy's popularity and career seemed to be in decline, though his staunchest fans refused to desert him. His esteem rose in the eyes of many with his next project, Coming to America (1987), a reunion with John Landis that allowed him to play an abundance of characters -- some of which he essayed so well that he was utterly unrecognizable. [PAR] Murphy bowed as a director, producer, and screenwriter with Harlem Nights (1989), a farce about 1930s black gangsters which had an incredible cast (including Murphy, Richard Pryor, Della Reese, Redd Foxx, Danny Aiello, Jasmine Guy, and Arsenio Hall), but was somewhat destroyed by Murphy's lazy, expletive-ridden script and clich\u00e9d plot that felt recycled from Damon Runyon stories. Churned out for Paramount, the picture did hefty box office (in the 60-million-dollar range) despite devastating reviews and reports of audience walkouts. Murphy's box-office triumphs continued into the '90s with a seemingly endless string of blockbusters, such as the Reginald Hudlin-directed political satire The Distinguished Gentleman (1992), that same year's \"player\" comedy Boomerang, and the Landis-directed Beverly Hills Cop III (1994). After an onscreen absence of two years following Cop, Murphy reemerged with a 1996 remake of Jerry Lewis' The Nutty Professor. As directed by Tom Shadyac and produced by the do-no-wrong Brian Grazer, the picture casts Murphy as Dr. Sherman Klump, an obese, klutzy scientist who transforms himself into Buddy Love, a self-obsessed narcissist and a hit with women. As an added surprise, Murphy doubles up his roles as Sherman and Buddy by playing each member of the Klump family (beneath piles and piles of latex). The Nutty Professor grossed dollar one and topped all of Murphy's prior efforts, earning well up into the hundreds of millions and pointing the actor in a more family-friendly direction. His next couple of features, Dr. Dolittle and the animated Mulan (both 1998), were children-oriented affairs, although in 1999 he returned to more mature material with the comedies Life (which he also produced) and Bowfinger; and The PJs, a fairly\n\n\n### Answer:\n48 hours </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

It was a seven- or eight-piece band formed in Chicago that recorded for Victor and featured the best New Orleans-style freelance musicians available, including cornetist George Mitchell, trombonist Kid Ory, clarinetists Omer Simeon and Johnny Dodds, banjoists Johnny St. Cyr and Bud Scott, double bass player John Lindsay, and drummers Andrew Hilaire and Baby Dodds.  [PAR] Recordings made by the group in Chicago in 1926\u201327, such as \"Black Bottom Stomp\", \"Smoke-House Blues\" and \"Doctor Jazz\" set a standard for small group jazz that is still unrivaled.  Morton's skills as a composer and arranger are apparent in the structure of the pieces, which combines clarity with variety and manages to maintain a balance between ensemble and solo playing while allowing for a substantial solo from every band member.  The quality of the recordings is further enhanced by the band's careful rehearsals, which were uncommon in early jazz performances.  A number of Morton's best piano solos can also be heard on these recordings.  [PAR] In 1928, Morton moved to New York, where he continued to make recordings under the name Red Hot Peppers, but collaborated with musicians from his regular band or from other orchestras.  By 1930, the name Red Hot Peppers was no longer used. [PAR] Recordings made by the Red Hot Peppers constituted a significant contribution to the race records industry, at its height in the 1920s and 1930s.  The masterful blend of composition and improvisation demonstrated by Morton and his colleagues set a precedent for early jazz.

[PAR] Spandau became the International War Crimes Prison in July 1947 with the arrival of the seven surviving principal Nazi defendants from the Nuremberg trials. Ten others had been hanged, and Field Marshal Hermann Goring committed suicide two hours before he was to meet the same fate. [PAR] The prison, built in 1871, has 134 cells with tiny, barred windows. Although the Spandau district, with its forests and parks, is a favored weekend resort for West Berliners, the jail squats in a corner of Spandau, just blocks from the tightly guarded East German border line. [PAR] Albert Speer, the wartime production chief, and Baldur von Schirach, the Hitler Youth leader, were released in 1966 after serving their 20-year sentences. Thereafter, Spandau Prison served as the world's most expensive and best watched single-occupancy dungeon. Vestige of Allied Rule [PAR] It also was the last vestige of postwar four-power rule in Germany. Guard details of 100 soldiers each from Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the United States continued in monthly rotation even after the sickly, aged Rudolf Hess become the only occupant. Guards manned the towers and cellblock monitoring stations even during Hess's periodic hospital stays. [PAR] To make room for the original seven prisoners, some 600 common criminals were removed from the fortress-like structure in the British sector of Berlin. The only improvements since 1871 were then made to tighten security with an outside 15-foot, barbed-wire fence, guard towers and search-lights. The prison also received a fresh coat of paint. [PAR] Inside the fence was a 28-yard ''dead space'' in which even guards were forbidden to walk at will. Access to the prison was through a guardhouse, which itself formed part of a 15-foot inner brick wall, and the Spartan cells for the seven inmates were on a single floor, in the building behind the wall. A Severe Regimen [PAR] There also were two small yards that served as the prisoners' access to the light of day. [PAR] Glaring lights and an eerie silence, broken occasionally by birdsong or a plane's drone overhead, prevailed. The rules, at first Draconian, were relaxed slightly over Soviet protests in the 1950's to maintain the prisoners' health and sanity. [PAR] Even so, the regimen remained severe, with letters or visits few and far between, sparse and strictly limited reading matter, and no talk permitted among prisoners, or between them and the guards, except under special circumstances. [PAR] The prison at times has been confused with one of Spandau's main attractions, the Italianate 16th-century citadel with its 12th-century Julius Tower\n\n\n### Answer:\nrudolf hess </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] Credit: Graeme Shannon shutterstock [PAR] A number of theories exist about the meaning and origin of the name. One theory is that the name is a mix of the Swahili word Kilima, meaning \"mountain,\" and the KiChagga word Njaro, loosely translated as \"whiteness.\" Another is that Kilimanjaro is the European pronunciation of a KiChagga phrase meaning \"we failed to climb it.\" [PAR] One of the Seven Summits (the highest peaks on the seven continents), Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania in east Africa. Kilimanjaro lies within the 292-square-mile (756 square kilometers) Kilimanjaro National Park.

[PAR] The man who brought the Chipmunks to life, Ross Bagdasarian, was born on January 27, 1919, in Fresno, California. He came to Los Angeles in 1950, and appeared in the films Viva Zapata, Stalag 17, and Rear Window. Bagdasarian also worked as a songwriter, reaching the charts first in 1956, as his production of Alfi & Harry's \"The Trouble with Harry\" hit number 44. He later charted two solo singles (recorded as David Seville), \"Armen's Theme\" and \"Gotta Get to Your House.\" In 1958, Bagdasarian began experimenting with a novel technique -- recording normal vocals but then speeding up the playback on a tape machine. The process yielded the number one hit \"Witch Doctor\" in early 1958, and the phenomenon mushroomed later that year when his Christmas gimmick single \"The Chipmunk Song\" spent four weeks at the top of the charts. \"Alvin's Harmonica\" reached number three just two months later, and Christmas reissues of \"The Chipmunk Song\" charted in the Top 40 over the next four years. The Alvin Show premiered on prime-time television in 1961, with all voices supplied by Bagdasarian. It only ran for one year, but was a success in a Saturday-morning slot. Five more Chipmunks singles charted in the early '60s, and five LPs also did well, including a Beatles cover album in 1964. [PAR] Although Bagdasarian died in 1972, his son Ross Jr. revived Alvin, Simon, and Theodore in 1979 on Saturday mornings and on the 1980 album Chipmunk Punk. The series became more popular than in the '60s, and albums of the Chipmunks singing country, Christmas, rock, and Hollywood favorites were big sellers, though they didn't enjoy chart success. Although the cartoon was no longer in production by the '90s, new Chipmunks records continued appearing, among them 1998's A-Files: Alien Files. [PAR] In 2007, a film series debuted with Alvin and the Chipmunks -- the first being so successful that it spawned three sequels: 2009's Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, 2011's Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, and 2015's Alvin and the Chipmunks 4.

It has stood as a symbol of hope and victory for the people of Libya through various shifts in power. [PAR] Advertisement [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] Under Muammar Gaddafi's rule, the national flag of Libya was the only monochromatic flag in the world. It consisted of a rectangle of green, with no insignia, stripes, or symbols of any kind. [PAR] Libya is a North African country on the Mediterranean coast. It has been a part of several kingdoms and imperial regimes, as well as had its share of dictators. Its flag reflects this chaotic history of the nation better than anything else. [PAR] 1951-present [PAR] \u2605 The current national flag of Libya was first used in 1951, as the flag of the Kingdom of Libya, which was formed in culmination of the Allied occupation of Libya after the Second World War. According to the Libyan Constitution at the time, [PAR] Chapter 1, Article 7: The national flag shall have the following dimensions: Its length shall be twice its breadth, it shall be divided into three parallel colored stripes, the uppermost being red, the center black and the lowest green, the black stripe shall be equal in area to the two other stripes combined and shall bear in its center a white crescent, between the two extremities of which there shall be a five-pointed white star. [PAR] Current flag of Libya [PAR] \u2605 This design was based on the flag of the Emirate of Cyrenaica. This administration came to power in British-controlled Libya in 1949. This flag was used with some minor modifications by the ruler of Cyrenaica, King Idris, after he became the ruler of Libya, as his Royal Standard. [PAR] Flag of the Emirate of Cyrenaica [PAR] \u2605 When the Emirate was replaced by the Kingdom of Libya, this design was not acceptable to other factions of the now-unified Libyan people. So, the design was modified to give the flag a new meaning in light of the newfound independence. The red stripe was added to signify the bloodshed that occurred under the Italian Fascist rule, and the green stripe was added to represent the prosperity and freedom of Libya. The crescent, retained from Idris' flag, as well as the green strip honor the major religion in Libya\u2015Islam. [PAR] \u2605 This original design was superseded several times during the reign of Muammar Gaddafi from 1969 to 2011. Immediately following the revolution that brought Gaddafi to power, the flag was changed to one showing the pan-Arab colors. These colors also form the basis for the flag of several other Arab states such as Egypt, Iraq, and the UAE, even to this day. This flag lasted from 1969 to 1972. [PAR] Flag of Libya from 1969-1972 [PAR] \u2605 This flag was replaced by the flag of the Federation of Arab Republics, which also included Egypt and Syria. This kept the color scheme the same, but added a hawk holding a scroll in the center stripe. The scroll held the Arabic name of the Federation. This Federation lasted from 1972 to 1977, and consequently the flag also went out of fashion in 1977. [PAR] Flag of the Federation of Arab Republics (1972-1977) [PAR] \u2605 In 1977, the most well-known and as yet longest-lasting flag of Libya, then known as Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, was established. The plain green rectangle signified the country's allegiance to Gaddafi's philosophy, encapsulated in his Green Book. As stated before, this was the only flag in the world to consist of a single color. [PAR] Flag of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya [PAR] \u2605 This flag was replaced by the original, 1951-1969 flag of the Kingdom of Libya after the 2011 Libyan Civil War and eventual ouster of Muammar Gaddafi.

Written from 1874 to 1876, the poem borrows the setting, some creatures, and eight portmanteau words from Carroll's earlier poem \"Jabberwocky\" in his children's novel Through the Looking Glass (1871). [PAR] Henry Holiday, the illustrator of the poem, thought of it as a \"tragedy\". [PAR] The plot follows a crew of ten trying to hunt the Snark, an animal which may turn out to be a highly dangerous Boojum. The only one of the crew to find the Snark quickly vanishes, leading the narrator to explain that it was a Boojum after all. The poem is dedicated to young Gertrude Chataway, whom Carroll met at the English seaside town Sandown in the Isle of Wight in 1875. Included with many copies of the first edition of the poem was Carroll's religious tract, An Easter Greeting to Every Child Who Loves \"Alice\". [PAR] The Hunting of the Snark was published by Macmillan in the United Kingdom in late March 1876, with illustrations by Henry Holiday. It had mixed reviews from reviewers who found it strange. The first printing of The Hunting of the Snark consisted of 10,000 copies. There were two reprintings by the conclusion of the year; in total, the poem was reprinted 17 times between 1876 and 1908. Carroll often denied knowing the meaning behind the poem; however, in an 1896 reply to one letter, he agreed with one interpretation of the poem as an allegory for the search for happiness. Scholars have found various meanings in the poem, among them existential angst, an allegory for tuberculosis, and a mockery of the Tichborne case. The Hunting of the Snark has been alluded to in various works and has been adapted for musicals, opera, plays, and music. [PAR] Plot [PAR] Setting [PAR] The Hunting of the Snark shares its fictional setting with Lewis Carroll's earlier poem \"Jabberwocky\" published in his children's novel Through the Looking-Glass (1871). Eight nonsense words from \"Jabberwocky\" appear in The Hunting of the Snark:  bandersnatch, beamish, frumious, galumphing, jubjub, mimsiest (which previously appeared as mimsy in \"Jabberwocky\"), outgrabe and uffish. In a letter to the mother of his young friend Gertrude Chataway, Carroll described the domain of the Snark as \"an island frequented by the Jubjub and the Bandersnatch\u2014no doubt the very island where the Jabberwock was slain.\" [PAR] Characters [PAR] The crew consists of ten members, whose descriptions all begin with the letter B: a Bellman, the leader; a \"Boots\", who is the only member of the crew without an illustration; a maker of Bonnets and Hoods; a Barrister, who settles arguments among the crew; a Broker, who can appraise the goods of the crew; a Billiard-marker, who is greatly skilled; a Banker, who possesses all of the crew's money; a Butcher, who can only kill beavers; a Beaver, who makes lace and has saved the crew from disaster several times; and a Baker, who can only bake wedding cake, forgets his belongings and his name, but possesses courage.

If you factor in her work as the lead singer of the Supremes in the 1960s, she may be the most successful. With her friends Mary Wilson , Florence Ballard, and Barbara Martin , Ross formed the Primettes vocal quartet in 1959. In 1960, they were signed to local Motown Records, changing their name to the Supremes in 1961. Martin then left, and the group continued as a trio. Over the next eight years, the Supremes (renamed \" Diana Ross and the Supremes \" in 1967, when Cindy Birdsong replaced Ballard) scored 12 number one pop hits. After the last one, \"Someday We'll Be Together\" (October 1969), Ross launched a solo career. [PAR] Motown initially paired her with writer/producers Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson , who gave her four Top 40 pop hits, including the number one \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" (July 1970). Ross branched out into acting, starring in a film biography of Billie Holiday , Lady Sings the Blues (November 1972). The soundtrack went to number one, and Ross was nominated for an Academy Award. [PAR] She returned to record-making with the Top Ten album Touch Me in the Morning (June 1973) and its chart-topping title song. This was followed by a duet album with Marvin Gaye , Diana & Marvin (October 1973), that produced three chart hits. Ross acted in her second movie, Mahogany (October 1975), and it brought her another chart-topping single in the theme song, \"Do You Know Where You're Going To.\" That and her next number one, the disco-oriented \"Love Hangover\" (March 1976), were featured on her second album to be titled simply Diana Ross (February 1976), which rose into the Top Ten. [PAR] Ross' third film role came in The Wiz (October 1978). The Boss (May 1979) was a gold-selling album, followed by the platinum-selling Diana (May 1980) (the second of her solo albums with that name, though the other, a 1971 TV soundtrack, had an exclamation mark). It featured the number one single \"Upside Down\" and the Top Ten hit \"I'm Coming Out.\" [PAR] Ross scored a third Top Ten hit in 1980 singing the title theme from the movie It's My Turn. She then scored the biggest hit of her career with another movie theme, duetting with Lionel Richie on \"Endless Love\" (June 1981). It was her last big hit on Motown; after more than 20 years, she decamped for RCA. She was rewarded immediately with a million-selling album, titled after her remake of the old Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers hit, \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love,\" which became her next Top Ten hit. The album also included the Top Ten hit \"Mirror, Mirror.\" [PAR] Silk Electric (October 1982) was a gold-seller, featuring the Top Ten hit \"Muscles,\" written and produced by Michael Jackson , and Swept Away (September 1984) was another successful album, containing the hit \"Missing You,\" but Ross had trouble selling records in the second half of the 1980s.

However, Coolidge was never a big fan of the song, as she felt the lyrics were never really finished. [PAR] The song was written by film composer John Barry and lyricist Tim Rice, who both worked on the music for Octopussy. Coolidge flew to London to record the song, and found that Rice was still working on the lyrics. \"Even after we did the record, the song felt a little incomplete,\" she said. [PAR] Audiences did not share Coolidge's reticence, and the song was a hit. Bond themes are not literal, but written to capture the mood of the characters. This song is written from the perspective of a typical Bond girl who falls in love with 007 and finds herself on a thrilling adventure. [PAR] It Octopussy's producer Cubby Broccoli who chose Coolidge for the theme song. His daughter was a big fan of Rita, and convinced her dad that she was the right vocalist. [PAR] This is one of the few Bond theme songs that is not titled after the movie; understandable when you consider the implications of releasing a song called \"Octopussy.\" The next Bond theme without the movie in the title was \" You Know My Name ,\" which Chris Cornell wrote for the 2006 film Casino Royale. Cornell had no interest in writing a song titled \"Casino Royale,\" but he would have written one called \"Octopussy.\" [PAR] \"Nobody wrote a song called 'Octopussy' but I think that was a mistake!,\" he told The Sun. \"They had a great opportunity and they squandered it.\" [PAR] This song plays a part in the 2012 movie Ted, where Mark Wahlberg's character takes the stage at a Norah Jones and sings the song (poorly) to his estranged girlfriend, since they watched the movie Octopussy on their first night together. Wahlberg gets booed off the stage, but his talking bear companion says, \"Still better than Katy Perry.\"[DOC] [TLE] Sam Smith sings theme song for James Bond film ... - CNNSam Smith sings theme song for James Bond film 'Spectre' - CNN.com [PAR] 1 of 22 [PAR] Photos: James Bond theme song singers [PAR] English singer Matt Monro is best known for his hearty rendition of the theme tune for 1963's \"From Russia with Love.\" (The first James Bond movie, \"Dr. No,\" had an instrumental title song.)

[PAR] Lions Gate Bridge, which officially opened on 29 May 1939, spans Burrard Inlet at the First Narrows, connecting Stanley Park and Vancouver \u2019s city centre to the North Shore. It\u2019s a suspension bridge \u2014 that is, a roadway suspended from cables that are saddled on high towers and securely anchored into the banks at either end of the bridge. With a 473 m main span, Lions Gate Bridge is one of the longest bridges in Canada, comparable in length to the Brooklyn Bridge in New York. The beauty of the bridge, which was named for the twin peaks in the North Shore Mountains, has made it an iconic symbol of Vancouver. [PAR] Background [PAR] The City of Vancouver long resisted the idea of building a bridge across the First Narrows because of the impact it would have on Stanley Park. Citizens defeated the idea in a plebiscite in 1927. The driving force behind overcoming these objections was Alfred James Towle Taylor, an engineer who had worked on a variety of large projects in British Columbia . Taylor moved to England, where he persuaded the Guinness brewing family to finance residential suburbs in West Vancouver. Through a syndicate called British Pacific Properties Ltd., the Guinness family offered to pay for a bridge that linked Vancouver to the North Shore. The fact that the bridge wouldn\u2019t cost the city any money and that its construction would create jobs during the desperate times of the Great Depression proved irresistible. [PAR] Construction [PAR] Construction began on 31 March 1937. Montr\u00e9al\u2019s Monsarrat and Pratley, Canada\u2019s leading bridge architects at the time, designed the span, which was similar in style to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Its elegance and spectacular views have won accolades ever since. One innovation in the construction of the bridge was the use of prefabricated strands for the suspension cables. An American firm supplied the wires, which were twisted into cable strands by a company in Qu\u00e9bec and delivered to the site by rail. Bridge workers then hoisted the cable strands into place over the tower saddles and tightened them with wrenches. [PAR] Opening to Present Day [PAR] The Guinness family paid exactly $5,873,837.17 to build the bridge and sold it for that same amount to the province in 1955. The bridge opened to traffic on 14 November 1938. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth presided over the official opening on 29 May 1939. Alfred J.T. Taylor, the shrewd visionary who inspired the bridge, wasn\u2019t present at the royal opening. The Guinness family\u2019s last involvement with the bridge came in 1986, when they added lights to the bridge as a gift to the city during Expo 86. [PAR] Even though the two lanes on the original bridge were later divided into three lanes, the bridge remains inadequate to growing traffic. Nevertheless, the city has resisted dramatic changes to the iconic structure. [PAR] Lilia D'Acres and Donald Luxton, Lions Gate (1999). [PAR] recommended[DOC] [TLE] The Landmark Lions Gate Bridge in Vancouver, BC Canada ...The Landmark Lions Gate Bridge in Vancouver, BC Canada \u2013 VivaBoo [PAR] Image By ecstaticist [PAR] The bridge is 1823 meters (5890 feet) in total, with a tower height of 111 meters (364 feet). It was designed with three reversible lanes, each of which are monitored by signals. The middle lane in particular changes direction based on the flow of traffic in order to ease congestion. This particular feature was installed after congestion made the bridge a nightmare to travel across. [PAR] Although the idea to build a bridge at this location was brought to life as early as 1890, the bridge didn\u2019t receive final approval and support to be built until 1933. Even after that, it took until 1937 for construction to begin. After much work and millions of dollars later, the bridge finally opened in November 1938. Then in May 1939, during a royal visit to Canada, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth presided over the official opening of the bridge.

Initial reviews expressed both bafflement and admiration. Some critics were floored, celebrating a sound so completely novel, while others were upset with Dylan\u2019s abandonment of traditional folk. [PAR] Commercially successful, the album peaked at number 3 on the US Billboard 200, and number 4 on the UK album charts and was soon certified gold. \u00a0Interestingly though, it didn\u2019t reach platinum status until the 1990s.

[PAR] Uploaded on Jan 20, 2010 [PAR] The Staple Singers were an American gospel, soul, and R&B singing group. Roebuck \"Pops\" Staples (1914-2000), the patriarch of the family, formed the group with his children Cleotha (b. 1934), Pervis (b. 1935), Yvonne (b. 1936), and Mavis (b. 1939). They are best known for their 1970s hits \"I'll Take You There\", \"Respect Yourself\", and \"Let's Do It Again\". [PAR] The family began appearing in Chicago-area churches in 1948, and signed their first professional contract in 1952. During their early career they recorded in an acoustic gospel-folk style with various labels: United Records, Vee-Jay Records, Checker Records, Riverside Records, and then Epic Records in 1965. While the family surname is \"Staples\", the group used the singular form for its name, resulting in the group's name being \"The Staple Singers\". [PAR] It was on Epic that the Staple Singers began moving into mainstream pop markets, with \"Why (Am I Treated So Bad)\" and \"For What It's Worth\" (Stephen Stills) in 1967. In 1968, the Staple Singers signed to Stax Records and released two albums with Steve Cropper and Booker T & the MG's \u2014 Soul Folk in Action and We'll Get Over. By 1970, Al Bell had become producer, and with Engineer Terry Manning, the family began recording at the famed Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, and Memphis' Ardent Studios, moving in a more funk and soul direction. [PAR] The first Stax hit was \"Heavy Makes You Happy (Sha-Na-Boom Boom)\". Their 1971 recording of \"Respect Yourself\", written by Luther Ingram and Mack Rice, peaked at number 2 on the R&B charts and was a number 12 pop hit as well. The song's theme of self-empowerment had universal appeal, released in the period immediately following the intense American civil rights movement of the 1960s. In 1972, the group had a huge No. 1 hit in the United States with \"I'll Take You There\". It topped both pop and R&B charts. \"If You're Ready (Come Go With Me)\" would become another big hit, reaching number 9 pop and number 1 on the R&B chart in 1973. [PAR] Then, after Stax's bankruptcy in 1975, they signed to Curtis Mayfield's label, Curtom Records, and released \"Let's Do It Again\", produced by Mayfield; the song became their second No. 1 pop hit in the US. In 1976, they collaborated with The Band on the song \"The Weight\" for their film The Last Waltz. However, they were not able to regain their momentum, releasing only occasional minor hits. Their 1984 album Turning Point featured their final Top 40 hit, a cover of Talking Heads' \"Slippery People\" (which also reached the Top 5 on the Dance chart). In 1994, they again performed the song \"The Weight\" with Country music artist Marty Stuart for MCA Nashville's Rhythm, Country and Blues compilation, somewhat re-establishing an audience. The song \"Respect Yourself\" was used by Spike Lee in the soundtrack to his movie Crooklyn, made in 1994. [PAR] In 1999, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Pops Staples died of complications from a concussion suffered in December 2000. In 2005, the group was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Mavis Staples has continued to carry on the family tradition and continues to add her vocal talents to both the projects of other artists and her own solo\n\n\n### Answer:\nstaple singers </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

She also sang Bach and Handel and Mahler, as well as traditional English folk songs. She had been suffering from bone cancer, and during her final performance of Orpheus, her thigh bone splintered. Ferrier finished the performance, and had to be carried out on a stretcher. She died a few months later. [PAR] HOME > CONTRALTO PROFILES > KATHLEEN FERRIER [PAR] Kathleen Ferrier was (and still is) one of the world\u2019s great singers.  Her appeal transcends all ages and seemingly all generations, more so  perhaps than any other singer. She died more than fifty years ago, yet  she is still remembered and her voice is still heard and loved by  millions around the world. [PAR] Kathleen Mary Ferrier was born on 22 April 1912 at Higher Walton , a village near Preston in  Lancashire in the North of England. She died in London on 8 October  1953. During her short career she went from one triumph to another,  received the adulation of her peers, of critics and of audiences all  over the world and still maintained her natural charm, nobility,  humility, humour and love for truth, people and life. [PAR] Kathleen\u2019s  father was the village schoolmaster at Higher Walton. A good singer  himself, he taught most of the music at the school. He later became a  headmaster in Blackburn and the family moved there when Kathleen was two  years old. [PAR] Kathleen did not begin her career as a singer. She was a keen member of  the school choir but even then she had a big voice and she was usually  asked just to stand at the back and sing quietly. Her mother, keen to  encourage Kathleen\u2019s musical interest, arranged piano lessons for her  and, as a talented young pianist of only 14 she passed the final grade of the Associated Board of the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music . A newspaper of the time called this \u2018an unprecedented success for so youthful a student.\u2019 [PAR] Kathleen  left school at 14 and went to work for the GPO in Blackburn, first in  the telegrams department and then as a switchboard operator. [PAR] In July 1930, at the age of 18, Kathleen took part in her first concert as a pianist, which was broadcast from Manchester ,  and began to accompany many local singers in a musical scene which was  very active in Lancashire. She regularly entered and won all the major  music festivals, but had become interesting in singing and began taking  some rudimentary lessons from the singers she accompanied. [PAR] By the time Kathleen was 23 she was married and living in Silloth ,  on the Cumbrian coast, where her husband was the local bank manager.  Kathleen gave piano lessons to the local children. When she entered the  prestigious Carlisle Festival in  1937 as a pianist, her husband bet her a shilling that she dare not  enter for the singing contest as well as the piano prize. Never one to  refuse a dare Kathleen accepted the challenge, entered the contralto  solo class and not only carried off both trophies, but won the first  prize for the best singer at the Festival. Carlisle was a turning point,  and this brilliant new singer was in great demand. In 1939 she made her  first radio broadcast as a singer. [PAR] Kathleen was approached by CEMA \u2013 the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts, and the forerunner of the Arts Council of Great Britain .  It was now wartime and CEMA were doing an ENSA style job in bringing  music to people in the factories, villages and hostels throughout  Britain, during the war years. In June 1941 she signed up with CEMA and  her professional career had effectively begun. The CEMA tours were hard  but invaluable and important training for Kathleen.

(Large Variety) - started working on it and sent a demo to Collio, who was looking for a song to record for the 1995 movie Dangerous Minds. [PAR] Starring Michelle Pfeiffer, the film is about a troubled school and the challenges faced by the students and the idealistic teacher played by Pfeiffer. Coolio wrote a lyric to express the feelings of despair and abandonment felt by the kids at the school, putting it to the track Sanders created. Along with the song's producer David Rasheed, Coolio and Sanders crafted the song, with Sanders singing the hook. [PAR] They still had to clear the sample from Stevie Wonder, and this proved difficult, as he rejected the first version of \"Gangsta's Paradise\" because it contained swearing. After Coolio rewrote the lyric, Wonder gave his approval. [PAR] Having grown up in Compton, California, Coolio could certainly relate to the gangsta lifestyle (so could the song's co-writer Larry Sanders, who survived a shooting), but he says that the song is not about him, but about the kids portrayed in Dangerous Minds who feel they don't have control of their lives. [PAR] This won the Grammy in 1995 for Best Rap Solo Performance. [PAR] Coolio's first hit came a year earlier with \"Fantastic Voyage,\" a party jam that made #3 in the US. His record company, MCA, was hoping he would stay in that groove and release more upbeat songs - when they heard the brooding \"Gangsta's Paradise\" they were afraid it would alienate his fans. [PAR] The song first appeared on the Dangerous Minds soundtrack, and when it became the basis for the movie's marketing campaign - heard in trailers and commercials for the film - MCA knew they had a hit on their hands. The song was released as a single, going to #1 in both the US and UK, and included on Coolio's second album, which was titled after the song. [PAR] Weird Al Yankovic recorded a popular parody of this called \"Amish Paradise.\" Coolio did not give him permission to use it and claimed Al \"desecrated\" his song. They eventually made peace and appeared together at the 1996 American Music Awards. [PAR] Weird Al wasn't the only one to parody the song: \"Shepherd's Paradise\" is the parody version performed by ApologetiX, while \"Algore Paradise\" is a parody by Paul Shanklin satirizing Al Gore and Bill Clinton. [PAR] The video took a novel approach, with Coolio appearing in a dialogue with Michelle Pfeiffer, who was in character as the teacher she portrayed in the film. Scenes from the movie were also used, but Coolio's original footage was shot so it would integrate those scenes, making the clip a united work as opposed to the typical approach of intercutting concert footage with film clips. Having the photogenic Pfeiffer (who also appeared in the gangsta favorite Scarface) in the video certainly helped the song's fortunes, while Coolio's song and appearance in the video brought the film to a much wider audience.

You can take side trips on the SeaBus to the North Shore or ride as many of Vancouver\u2019s 1000 buses as you can squeeze into the day. [PAR] DayPasses are available at the SeaBus station, Sky Train station, Safeway grocery stores, 7/11 convenience stores, Save On Foods and at many London Drugs and Shoppers\u2019 Drug Marts. [PAR] The Sky Train is not just a bargain, however. It is one of the best ways to see Vancouver and the surrounding area. From the SkyTrain, you get great views of downtown, neighborhoods and the splendor of the North Shore mountains. [PAR] And perhaps, best of all, the SkyTrain\u2019s CanadaLine travels between Vancouver International Airport and downtown Vancouver every 8 minutes at peak hours and every 12 minutes in early morning and evening  for $3.25 per person one way. This 25 minute trip is scenic, fast and worry free. It\u2019s the perfect way to get between downtown Vancouver and the airport. [PAR] You can catch the Sky Train at any Sky Train stop, but for this itinerary, we\u2019ll assume you\u2019re picking it up next to Canada Place, at Waterfront Station, which is its terminus. [PAR] If you only want to go to the heart of downtown, take the SkyTrain two stops and exit at the Granville Station. That will put you in the heart of downtown Vancouver. You can shop at Pacific Centre Mall or walk a couple of blocks south on Granville to Vancouver\u2019s most fashionable shopping area, Robson Street. [PAR] If you want to see some of the attractions outside Vancouver proper, the SkyTrain is an easy way to do it. [PAR] For example, you can take the SkyTrain to Metrotown, B.C\u2019s largest shopping complex with over 500 shops and services, 22 cinemas and the Metropolis Entertainment Centre. Metrotown is only eight stops from the Waterfront Station. [PAR] Six stops beyond Metrotown is the centre of New West, Columbia Station. It puts you near the Canada Games Pool where you can swim in the Olympic size swimming pool or work out in the fitness centre and training circuit. The facility is open daily from 6:30am-10:30pm. From the SkyTrain, transfer to Bus #102. [PAR] You can also visit the West Coast College of Massage Therapy just two blocks west (right) of Columbia Station. WCCMT offers massage therapy as well as herbal and aromatic baths, clay packs, fullbody wraps and salt glow therapy. [PAR] Services are provided by advanced students under the supervision of an instructor. The WCCMT is open Monday \u2013 Friday 9:00 am to 8:00 PM and Saturday 9:00 am-4:00pm. [PAR] From The Columbia Station you are just four stops from completing the entire 39 minute grand tour to the end of the line Surrey\u2019s King George Station. [PAR] On your return trip, leave the SkyTrain at the Science World-Main St. Station. From there, pick up an Aquabus or False Creek Ferry for a tour of False Creek. The Aquabus stops at Hornby Street, Granville Island, Yaletown and Science World. Bicycles & dogs are welcome. Ferries operate every day 7 am \u2013 8 PM in winter and 7 am \u2013 10 PM in summer. [PAR] To get back to downtown Vancouver after your ferry trip, either get back on the SkyTrain or take the bus, the number of which will depend on where you leave the ferry.\n\n\n### Answer:\ncanada </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

(AP) -- If the Indiana Pacers could make the NBA schedule, they would probably be playing the Detroit Pistons again on Sunday. [PAR] Probably Monday, as well. [PAR] One night after blowing the Pistons out in Indianapolis, the Pacers did the same thing at the Palace on Saturday night. David West scored 16 points and Paul George had a double-double to help Indiana cruise to a 90-72 win over Detroit. [PAR] ''Any time you play a team back-to-back, they are going to be dialed into what you do, especially with this being the fourth time this season.'' George said. ''We knew they were going to make it a different game this time, but we take pride in our defense.'' [PAR] The Pacers won 114-82 Friday night in Indianapolis, and led by as many as 21 in the return leg. George finished with 12 points and 12 rebounds for Indiana, which had five players in double figures and got Danny Granger on the floor for the first time this season. [PAR] ''Our defense carried us throughout most of the game - we held those guys to 33 percent,'' said Indiana coach Frank Vogel. ''We struggled to make shots this time, but we still ended up at 45 percent, which is pretty good.'' [PAR] Granger, who sat out the first 55 games of the season with a knee injury, missed his first eight shots before hitting one in the fourth quarter. He finished with two points on 1-for-10 shooting in 18 minutes. [PAR] ''He was rusty, but that's to be expected,'' Vogel said. ''That's why we aren't throwing him out there for 40 minutes. He's been a lot better in practices, but this was his first time at game speed in a long time.'' [PAR] Will Bynum led Detroit with 15 points before getting ejected for striking Tyler Hansbrough in the groin in the fourth quarter. Hansbrough said he didn't know what caused it, and Bynum wasn't willing to be specific. [PAR] ''It was just something that happened in the heat of the moment - it wasn't something I planned intentionally,'' Bynum said. ''There's a level of frustration when you are getting drilled by the same team for the second night in a row.'' [PAR] After trailing by as many as 43 in Indiana, the Pistons started the second game of the home-and-home series by missing 16 of their first 17 shots. [PAR] ''Our starting unit defends as well as any I have ever been around,'' Vogel said. ''They've been doing this all year, and that's a big reason for our success.'' [PAR] Still, as good as Indiana's defense may be, the Pacers aren't usually holding teams to under 6 percent shooting for long stretches of the game. [PAR] ''We got a good example tonight of playoff basketball,'' Pistons coach Lawrence Frank said. ''We missed some shots at the rim early on, and then we got frustrated and started getting away from what we wanted to do.'' [PAR] The Pacers struggled to take advantage, turning the ball over seven times in the first nine minutes of the game. That's when Granger checked in for the first time this season.

Competitors and critics may sally forth and give it battle; lesser authors may adopt its theme or mimic its style; but its image will remain\u2014an image somehow more perfect, and more captivating of a deeper truth, than any other that belongs to the civilization which holds it dear. [PAR] Although the English world is blessed with much extraordinary poetry\u2014so much so, that even a sampling of its finest works could fill many volumes\u2014there are, I think, a few selections whose elite status is beyond question. I will not attempt to compile such a list here; but I happily proffer Rudyard Kipling\u2019s famous poem \u201cIf\u2013\u201d as one such creation which has earned its place of glory. [PAR] For those unfamiliar with the poem, it is perhaps helpful to know that Kipling wrote \u201cIf\u2013\u201d at the height of his popularity in Britain, when he was the most representative author of one of the greatest empires the world had ever seen. Appearing in 1910, shortly after Kipling received his Nobel Prize for Literature, \u201cIf\u2013\u201d stands as one of the quintessential exhortations to the inculcation of maturity, courage, and self-discipline in its reader\u2014of what Victorian and Edwardian society would have proudly called the manly virtues. [PAR] With just four brief stanzas to the entire poem, it is at once a stunningly succinct and fascinating piece. It begins: [PAR] If you can keep your head when all about you [PAR] Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, [PAR] If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, [PAR] But make allowance for their doubting too; [PAR] If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, [PAR] Or being lied about, don\u2019t deal in lies, [PAR] Or being hated, don\u2019t give way to hating, [PAR] And yet don\u2019t look too good, nor talk too wise [PAR] Proceeding thus, we see that Kipling\u2019s unusual, if pithy, choice of title takes on a new importance from the poem\u2019s first line. It is apparent that the conditional word \u201cif\u201d is not merely the idle vanguard of each verse\u2014it symbolically represents that very pivot of free will upon which our lives turn, and therefore implies the weight of a struggle which might or might not be fulfilled. The possibility of failure looms like a shadow over all that follows. It is as if Kipling wants his readers to feel the risk of this journey through the labyrinthine contradictions of life; and he warns us according to the fate of most men, which is the threat of succumbing to the hatred, calumny, and thoughtless impatience of the world. [PAR] Following from the first stanza, the poem ascends through a series of additional aspirations and virtues, raising us to contemplate ever more lofty standards of attainment. Many of these memorable lines have been adopted as if mottoes for the boldest ventures in human discovery and commerce; others have been engraved upon the architraves of storied sporting arenas, as with the couplet famously adorning the Centre Court of the Championships at Wimbledon: [PAR] If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster [PAR] And treat those two imposters just the same [PAR] Accordingly, perseverance and right character are given as superior to victory itself. But it is sorely misleading to describe this poem, in the common way, as a simple paean to individualistic stoicism\u2014for there is really much that is Aristotelian, and not a little that is Christian, in the ethics it propounds. Particularly in the final stanza, we find that Kipling draws his reader beyond the pinnacles of strength and endurance, and towards a sort of balance, or ability to grasp the precise measure of the good in a variety of changing circumstances. Perhaps its finest lines reside in this last verse which reads: [PAR]\n\n\n### Answer:\ntriumph and disaster </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Intending a career in law, he failed his bar exams and instead entered the Slade School of Art in London. [PAR] Lancaster initially worked alongside Betjeman at the Architectural Review . In 1936 he published Progress at Pelvis Bay, the first of his many books of social and architectural satire. In 1939 he became cartoonist at the Daily Express, where he pioneered the pocket cartoon, a single-panel, single-column topical drawing appearing on the front page, since imitated in several British newspapers. In these he sympathetically mocked the British upper classes, personified by his characters William (8th Earl of Littlehampton, formerly Viscount Draynflete) and his wife Maudie.

Both organizations operated most forcefully in the 1980s and early 1990s, when Peru's government fought a costly war against both insurgencies, but disproportionately the Shining Path. The U.S. State Department identifies Shining Path as a terrorist organization, but Tupac Amaru hasn't been listed as such since 1999. Shining Path had a period of dormancy in the 1990s, but the organization has since resurged, along with the Peruvian cocaine trade. Analysts say the group is small in numbers, but it could gain support in rural areas that have been neglected by the Peruvian government. [PAR] Share [PAR] Email [PAR] Origins of Terrorism in Peru [PAR] The Shining Path began in the late 1960s as a small communist revolutionary group led by a philosophy professor named Abimael Guzm\u00e1n. Guzm\u00e1n opposed Peru's prevailing political elites. His followers drew on Marxism and the example of Cuba's Fidel Castro, and coalesced into a significant and violent guerrilla army which regularly used terrorist tactics in their effort to destabilize and overthrow the Peruvian government. At the height of its power, Shining Path's ranks numbered around ten thousand, according to a report from the Jamestown Foundation . A paper from the Council on Hemispheric Affairs (COHA) says the main goal of Shining Path has always been to overthrow the existing Peruvian government and political institutions and replace them with a communist revolutionary command. Guzm\u00e1n, adopting the nom de guerre Presidente Gonzalo, attempted to do all of this while resisting overt ties with foreign powers or other Latin American leftist groups, including the contemporary Peruvian group known as the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. [PAR] Tupac Amaru, or MRTA, was named for an eighteenth-century rebel leader who fought Spanish colonial control. The group, which is Marxist, was founded to rid Peru of all imperialist elements and supported many of the communist principles that led to the Cuban revolution. It took up arms in 1984 and operated mainly in rural areas. According to the book \" Peru's MRTA: Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement,\" which examines the group's philosophy and tactics, the MRTA's primary goal was to reform the Peruvian government and create a society in which ownership of property was shared and everyone enjoyed similar levels of prosperity. MRTA members decided the best way to fight the war was to attack the holdings of Peru's wealthy elite , but sought to cause the least amount of injuries possible by frequently warning of its attacks in advance. Experts say Tupac Amaru has been less violent, in general, than Shining Path. [PAR] In December 1996, during the rule of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, fourteen MRTA members occupied the Japanese Ambassador's residence in Lima, holding 72 hostages for over four months. Fujimori ordered armed forces to raid the residence in April 1997, rescuing all but one of the remaining hostages and killing all fourteen MRTA militants, including the remaining leaders of the terrorist organization. Shortly after this uprising, MRTA's powers and operations within Peru scaled back dramatically. [PAR] Strategies [PAR] Shining Path's strategy, according to the COHA paper, was to use violence to bring down Peru's democratic government, disrupt the economy, destroy the state's reputation among the peasantry and, ultimately, ruin its reputation among the population in general. A New York Times report looking at rebuilding efforts in the aftermath of Shining Path violence says the group often hacked its victims to death with machetes to save ammunition. The Peruvian government-sponsored Truth and Reconciliation Commission issued a report (PDF) in 2004 saying that the group's human rights violations evolved into \"generalized and systemic practice.\" Guzm\u00e1n's capture and imprisonment in 1992 derailed the Shining Path's momentum, and remnants of\n\n\n### Answer:\nperu </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] Early life [PAR] Matthau was born Walter John Matthow on October 1, 1920, in New York City's Lower East Side. [PAR] His mother, Rose (n\u00e9e Berolsky), was a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant who worked in a garment sweatshop, and his father, Milton Matthow, was a Russian Jewish peddler and electrician, from Kyiv, Ukraine.subscription required  As part of a lifelong love of practical jokes, Matthau himself created the rumors that his middle name was Foghorn and his last name was originally Matuschanskayasky (under which he is credited for a cameo role in the film Earthquake). [PAR] As a young boy, Matthow attended a Jewish non-profit sleepaway camp, Tranquillity Camp, where he first began acting in the shows the camp would stage on Saturday nights. He also attended Surprise Lake Camp. His high school was Seward Park High School. He worked for a short time as a concession stand cashier in the Yiddish Theater District.  [PAR] Career [PAR] During World War II, Matthau served in the U.S. Army Air Forces with the Eighth Air Force in Britain as a B-24 Liberator radioman-gunner, in the same 453rd Bombardment Group as James Stewart. He was based at RAF Old Buckenham, Norfolk during this time. He reached the rank of staff sergeant and became interested in acting.  [PAR] He took classes in acting at the Dramatic Workshop of the New School with German director Erwin Piscator. He often joked that his best early review came in a play where he posed as a derelict. One reviewer said, \"The others just looked like actors in make-up, Walter Matthau really looks like a skid row bum!\" Matthau was a respected stage actor for years in such fare as Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? and A Shot in the Dark. He won the 1962 Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a play. [PAR] Matthau appeared in the pilot of Mister Peepers (1952) with Wally Cox. For reasons unknown he used the name Leonard Elliot. His role was of the gym teacher Mr. Wall. He made his motion picture debut as a whip-wielding bad guy in The Kentuckian (1955) opposite Burt Lancaster. He played a villain in King Creole (1958), in which he gets beaten up by Elvis Presley). Around the same time, he made Ride a Crooked Trail with Audie Murphy, and Onionhead (both 1958) starring Andy Griffith; the latter was a flop. Matthau had a featured role opposite Griffith in the well received drama A Face in the Crowd (1957), directed by Elia Kazan.

WELKOS | TIMES STAFF WRITER [PAR] Actor Brandon Lee, the 28-year-old son of the late kung fu star Bruce Lee, was killed Wednesday after a small explosive charge used to simulate gunfire went off inside a grocery bag during filming on a movie set in Wilmington, N.C. [PAR] Lee, who many believed was on the threshold of stardom similar to that attained by his father two decades earlier, had been working on the $14-million movie \"The Crow,\" produced by Edward Pressman and Jeff Most. Lee played a rock star brought back from the grave who adopts the persona of a night bird to avenge his own and his girlfriend's untimely deaths. [PAR] For the scene, directed by Alex Proyas, Lee was walking through a doorway carrying the grocery bag as another actor fired blanks at him from 15 feet away, police said. [PAR] At that moment, according to a spokesman for the producers, Lee activated a toggle switch underneath the grocery bag and set off the small charge, called a squib, a device commonly used on movie sets to simulate the effects of gunfire. [PAR] \"It wasn't the first time they tried the scene,\" the spokesman said. [PAR] But this time, Lee was struck in the abdomen by a projectile, which lodged in his body. [PAR] It is still unclear whether the projectile came from the gun or the grocery bag or both. \"When the other actor fired a shot, the explosive charge went off inside the bag,\" said Wilmington police Officer Michael Overton. \"After that, we don't know what happened.\" [PAR] Police released only sketchy details of the incident, declining to identify the actor who fired the gun or who else on the Carolco Studios set was a witness. [PAR] Wilmington police Sgt. R.E. Norvell said detectives would have to wait for an autopsy--which is planned for today--to find out what kind of projectile struck the actor. [PAR] Police said that the incident was being treated as an accident, but was still under investigation. [PAR] Lee collapsed on the set at 12:30 a.m. and was rushed to New Hanover Regional Medical Center. Doctors said he showed vital signs when he arrived at the emergency room but was unresponsive. [PAR] The actor died at 1:04 p.m. after surgery without regaining consciousness, a hospital spokeswoman said. Lee's mother was at the hospital when he died, the spokeswoman said.

The speed is worked out by the vehicle being driven over a fixed length and is averaged out over two runs in opposite directions. The vehicle must exceed the previous record by 1% in order to make a new record. [PAR] Women have also been involved with the land speed record. Dorothy Levitt broke the women\u2019s world speed record in 1906 with a speed of 91mph gaining the sobriquet of \"Fastest Girl on Earth\". Subsequently, in 1965 Lee Breedlove broke the record with her Sonic 1 going at 308.506 mph.\u00a0 [PAR] The first ever recorded land speed record was on 18th December 1898 in Ach\u00e8res, Yvelines, France with the electric powered Jeantaud Duc with a speed of 39.24mph. [PAR] On 26th January 1906 on Ormond Beach, USA, Fred Marriot broke the 100mph barrier with a record of 127.66mph with the Stanley Rocket. [PAR] Later, on 2nd November 1965 Craig Breedlove, husband of Lee Breedlove, broke the 500mph barrier with the Sonic 1 in USA gaining a speed record of 555.485mph. However this record was unofficial as it only had 3 wheels and was not wheel-driven. [PAR] Then, on 4th October, Brit Richard Noble gained a speed record of 634.05mph in the Black Rock Desert, USA with the Thrust 2 and its Turbojet. [PAR] Just 14 years later, on 15th October 1997, Andy Green reached the speed of 760.343mph in the Black Rock Desert, USA with the Thrust SSC and its Turbofan. He holds the current land speed record. [PAR] However, now several teams have wanted to break the speed barrier of 1000mph and one of these projects is the Bloodhound SSC. In 2012 Richard Noble claimed that the car was a representation of Thrust SSC and they didn\u2019t have permission. [PAR] Nevertheless, the Bloodhound SSC is a British supersonic, pencil shaped vehicle with a jet engine and the intention to exceed 1000mph. The runway has been built in Hakskeen Pan in the Northern Cape, South Africa. It is 12 miles long by 2 miles wide and the record attempt is scheduled to take place in 2016. The 7.5 tonne vehicle has to be flown from Bristol to South Africa in order for the record to take place. Also following the rules, it would have to be turned over in order to make its second lap. It is estimated that it would only take the Bloodhound 55seconds to reach the speed of 1000mph. The project has also inspired many secondary schools like the Heathland School to take part in workshops with model, rocket powered cars. This hopefully gives children an insight into STEM based subjects and activities. [PAR] Now, fingers crossed that the Bloodhound SSC will achieve a 1000mph speed record!

He quit school at the age of 17 to join the Navy. His naval career was ended following a motorcycle accident while on shore leave in 1955. Shortly thereafter he heard an up and coming singer named Elvis Presley and decided on a singing career of his own. His excellent voice helped to hook him up with Norfolk disk jockey Tex Davis who pushed him through to Capitol Records where he recorded the million selling Be-Bop-A-Lula in 1956. While his first record earned him several movie appearances including The Girl Can't Help It (1956) and Hot Rod Gang (1958) and helped him to get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, his success was short lived. His original Blue Caps band broke up fairly quickly and his fame in America dwindled as rebellious rockers of the 1950s were replaced by clean cut teen idols of the early 1960s. Vincent moved to Britain where he was a cult figure in 1959 and remained there for a decade when he returned to America in 1969 with a new record deal and enjoyed a brief revival amongst the hippy teenagers in California who revered him as a legend. His new found fame was cut short by his death on October 12, 1971 at the age of 36 years following complications of a bleeding ulcer and seizure. He had been married four times and was a reputed hard drinker which most likely caused his death. [PAR] - IMDb Mini Biography By: Timothy W.

[PAR] Directed by former National Theatre artistic director Richard Eyre , the show marks the first collaboration between Andrew Lloyd Webber , lyricist Don Black and playwright Christopher Hampton (who has written the book) since their 1993 musical Sunset Boulevard. Lloyd Webber and Black have also worked together on Tell Me on a Sunday (1980) and Aspects of Love (1989). [PAR] The 1963 Profumo Affair, one of the most notorious political scandals of the 20th century, takes its name from the Minister of War John Profumo, who reputedly shared a mistress, Christine Keeler, with a Soviet spy and went on to lie when questioned about it in the House of Commons. The headline-grabbing affair shocked society and rocked the self-righteous Conservative Government of Harold Macmillan, leading ultimately to the resignations of both Profumo and Macmillan and ushering in a new era, as the \"stuffy\" 1950s gave way to the \"Swinging Sixties\". [PAR] Rather than the more infamous players of Profumo, Keeler or Macmillan, however, the musical takes its name from, the person the press release refers to as the real victim of the affair: Stephen Ward, a libertarian osteopath and artist who introduced Profumo to Keeler at a country house party. He committed suicide on the last day of the court trial. [PAR] Andrew Lloyd Webber [PAR] The Profumo Affair has previously inspired stage versions including Hugh Whitemore's 1997 West End play A Letter of Resignation, starring Edward Fox, and the 2007 fringe musical A Model Girl, starring Emma Williams.

Gilmour was born in Cambridge, England on March 6, 1946; his parents were both involved in education -- his father was a lecturer in Zoology at Cambridge University and his mother was a teacher -- and as a schoolboy, Gilmour struck up a friendship with a boy who attended the same grade school, Roger Barrett, who later gained the nickname Syd. Gilmour became re-acquainted with Barrett while they were studying at the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology; both were interested in music and began learning to play guitar in their spare time, as did Barrett's friend Roger Waters. In 1963, Gilmour joined a rock group, Jokers Wild, which specialized in R&B covers; in 1965, he and Barrett took the summer off and spent several months busking and traveling through France, though the adventure didn't pay off financially. After returning to England, Gilmour played with a group called Flowers for a while, as well as a revamped version of Jokers Wild called Bullitt; meanwhile, Barrett and Waters teamed up with Rick Wright and Nick Mason to form a group called the Tea Set, which was later renamed Pink Floyd. In 1967, Pink Floyd was the toast of London's burgeoning psychedelic scene on the strength of the singles \"Arnold Layne\" and \"See Emily Play,\" and the album Piper at the Gates of Dawn. However, Barrett had become increasingly unstable, sometimes becoming catatonic on-stage or playing different songs than his bandmates, and as his ability to perform was compromised, Gilmour was invited to join the group to help with guitar and vocals when Barrett was having trouble. However, after a few shows it became evident that Gilmour's presence wasn't enough to rescue Barrett, and the group's leader was let go as Gilmour became the band's new lead guitarist by default, and he would produce and play on Barrett's two solo albums before Barrett retired from music. [PAR] Gilmour made his recording debut with Pink Floyd on 1968's A Saucerful of Secrets, and over the next several years, the group's sound evolved from pop-friendly psychedelic to ambitious progressive and experimental rock. Gilmour's guitar became a key part of Pink Floyd's aural signature, and he played a larger role in the group's songwriting; their evolving approach culminated with 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon, which became a massive international hit and firmly established them as one of the biggest British acts of the day. Pink Floyd's success continued with 1975's Wish You Were Here, but as Waters began to dominate the group's songwriting and conceptualizing, Gilmour began looking for other opportunities to express himself. He'd already made guest appearances on albums by Roy Harper and Hawkwind, and during the recording of 1977's Animals, Gilmour began work on his first solo album, released in 1978 simply as David Gilmour. In 1978, he also co-produced Kate Bush's debut album, The Kick Inside, and he contributed guitar work to Wings' 1979 release Back to the Egg. 1979's The Wall became another massive success for Pink Floyd, and Gilmour co-wrote the stand-out track \"Comfortably Numb,\" but tensions within the group grew during the recording of the album -- Rick Wright was fired during the sessions -- and after the long sessions which produced 1983's The Final Cut, Pink Floyd briefly fell apart. [PAR] Following the band's splintering, Gilmour released his second solo album, 1984's About Face, and he lent his talents as a guitarist to a number of projects, including albums by Paul McCartney, Bryan Ferry, Pete Townshend, and Supertramp, and produced the debut album for the Dream Academy.

Throughout the Middle Ages Bradford was, like Leeds, an important woollen and textile centre but the town did not really begin to grow until the nineteenth century. The industrial growth of Bradford was to attract labour from all over Europe and the British empire so that Bradford ha become famed as a cultural melting pot with people of Irish, German, Italian, Eastern European, Caribbean and Asian descent. [PAR] Most of Bradford's famous buildings are Victorian, but one of Bradford's oldest buildings is its fifteenth century cathedral in Church Bank, which was Bradford's parish church of St Peter until Bradford was created a diocese in 1919. It is a large church reflecting Bradford's size and status in medieval times. [PAR] A steam powered mill was erected at Bradford in 1798, but the real growth of the town was in the nineteenth century. Most of the impressive buildings of the city date from the Victorian period including the Wool Exchange of 1864 and Bradford City Hall of 1873 which were both designed by the Bradford architects Lockwood and Mawson. The style of the City Hall is Victorian Gothic with a huge clock tower based on the Pallazzo Vecchio in Florence. [PAR] Bradford's Victorian buildings were often influenced by classical European styles. Even industrial buildings were influenced by such styles including Lister's Mill (1873) in the Manningham area of Bradford, with its 250 feet high chimney styled like an Italian bell tower. [PAR] Perhaps the most famous Victorian building in Bradford is Lockwood and Mawson's St George's Hall, a concert hall in Bridge Street dating from 1851. A more unusual feature of Bradford's Victorian history, occasionally promoted as a tourist attraction, is the Undercliffe Cemetery which is famous for its extravagant and outstanding Victorian funereal art and architecture. [PAR] Buildings of the more modern era include the National Media Museum which opened in 1983. It has claimed to be the home of the world's biggest lens, the smallest camera and the first ever photographic likeness. [PAR] The population growth of Bradford in the Victorian age was as follows - 13,000 in 1801 growing to 104,400 in 1851, to 280,000 by 1901. [PAR] FAMOUS PEOPLE OF BRADFORD [PAR] Famous folk born in Bradford include the novelist and playwright J.B.Priestley (1894-1984). His full name was John Boynton Priestley. Priestley's works reflect his typical blunt Yorkshire characteristics. Staying on the literary front, the Bronte family of nearby Haworth, can almost be claimed for the Bradford area. [PAR] Social campaigners connected with Bradford include Richard Oastler who campaigned against the use of child labour in the mills and the Bradford MP, W.E Forster who was the man behind the Compulsory Education Act of 1870. On the artistic front Bradford is famed as the birthplace of the artist David Hockney who was born in the town in 1937 as well as being the birthplace of the composer Frederick Delius (1862-1934) whose parents were German immigrants. [PAR] SALTAIRE AND BRADFORD'S SURROUNDS [PAR] One of the most interesting places in the neighbourhood of Bradford is Saltaire near Shipley, three miles north of Bradford. Saltaire was a model village built in the 1850s by Sir Titus Salt and it was one of the first model villages in the world. The village stands at the entrance to Lister park, a healthy location chosen by Sir Titus for his new alpaca and mohair cloth mill - the famous Salt's Mill of 1853. [PAR] The model village was built for the workers at the mill. Eight-hundred or so houses were built, along with a public dining hall, schools, a hospital, a church and almshouses. Almost every provision was built except for a pub. Salt's Mill is now a gallery which displays the work of the Bradford born artist David Hockney. [PAR] Bolling Hall in Bradford's Bowling park was built around a fifteenth century pele tower, a fortified tower house more typical of Northumberland. The building was extended in the 17th century and then in the 18th century by the architect John Carr. Families connected with Bolling Hall include the Bollings, Tempests and Saviles.

Dawson's signature style and habit of kissing all the women on the show earned him a great deal of recognition. [PAR] Sadly, Richard Dawson passed away on June 2, 2012, due to esophageal cancer.

Combs was a comedian and fit in well with the show's format and style, though fans didn't take to him immediately. This likely has more to do with their love for Richard Dawson than any lacking on Combs' part. He hosted the show until 1994. [PAR] Combs' story ends in tragedy.

As time went on, Hitler became increasingly suspicious and more heavily guarded, and often changed his schedule at the last minute. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] In the 2008 movie \u201cValkyrie,\u201d about the July plot actor Tom Cruise portrayed Claus von Stauffenberg. [PAR] The men behind the July Plot were a group of high-level German military leaders who recognized that Hitler was leading Germany in a suicidal war on two fronts. They decided to assassinate him then stage a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, with the belief that a new government in Berlin would save Germany from complete destruction at the hands of the Allies. [PAR] The July Plot leaders included Colonel General Ludwig Beck (1880-1944), former chief of the army general staff, Colonel General Friedrich Olbricht (1888-1944) and Major General Henning von Tresckow (1901-44). Lieutenant Colonel Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg (1907-44), chief of staff of the reserve army, also played a central role in the conspiracy. [PAR] July Plot: July 20, 1944 [PAR] During a July 20 meeting in a Wolf\u2019s Lair conference room with Hitler and more than 20 German officers and staff, Stauffenburg planted an explosives-packed briefcase under a table that the Nazi leader was using. Stauffenberg then said he had to make a phone call and left the room. Another officer subsequently happened to move the briefcase out of place, farther away from Hitler. The bomb detonated at 12:42 p.m. One person died instantly as a result of the powerful explosion and three others were mortally wounded; however, Hitler suffered only minor injuries. He was even well enough to keep an appointment with Benito Mussolini (1883-1945) that same afternoon, and gave the Italian dictator a tour of site where the blast occurred. [PAR] After the bomb went off, Stauffenberg, believing Hitler was dead, flew to Berlin to initiate Operation Valkyrie, a plan to use Germany\u2019s reserve army to stage an uprising against the Nazi regime. However, with no official confirmation of Hitler\u2019s demise, the plan stalled. When the news came through that Hitler was alive, General Friedrich Fromm (1888-1945), commander of the reserve army and someone who condoned the July Plot, turned on the conspirators in order to have his association with them covered up. Stauffenberg and Olbricht were arrested and executed on July 21. [PAR] Hundreds of people thought to be involved in the conspiracy also soon were arrested, and around 200 eventually were executed. Beck was arrested and chose to commit suicide rather than stand trial. Tresckow committed suicide after he learned the July Plot had failed. Erwin Rommel (1891-1944), a highly respected field marshal also linked to the plot, was given the choice of facing trial or committing suicide in order to spare his family. He opted to take his own life. (Because Rommel was a renowned figure, the Nazis covered up the true cause of his death and gave him a state funeral.) Fromm also was executed by firing squad in 1945. [PAR] July Plot: Aftermath [PAR] In the aftermath of the July Plot, Hitler and his top officials took an even firmer grip on Germany and its war machine. The Nazi leader became certain that fate had spared him. \u201cHaving escaped death in so extraordinary a way,\u201d Hitler stated, \u201cI am now more than ever convinced that the great cause which I serve will survive its present perils and that everything can be brought to a good end.\u201d [PAR] On April 30, 1945, shortly before Germany surrendered to the Allies, Hilter committed suicide. The Wolf\u2019s Lair compound, where the Nazi leader spent more than 800 days between 1941 and 1944, was blown up by the Soviet army in January 1945.

Answer: Jock Hutchison. [PAR] Who was the first golfer born in the United States to win the British Open? Answer: Walter Hagen . [PAR] The answers are different, but the two golfers who are the answers to these questions won their Open Championships in back-to-back years. [PAR] First American Citizen to Win the British Open [PAR] Jock Hutchison is the golfer who has the distinction of being the first citizen of the United States to win the Open Championship. He did it at the 1921 British Open . [PAR] Hutchison was a Scotsman by birth; in fact, he was born in St. Andrews. But he gained American citizenship in 1920. The next year, the Open was played at The Old Course at St. Andrews , and Hutchison returned to his native home to play it.

Odd twist to the story: Wethered had to be talked into showing up for the playoff. Read our recap of the tournament for more. [PAR] First USA-Born Golfer to Win the British Open [PAR] Just one year after Hutchison's victory, \"The Haig,\" Walter Hagen, won the 1922 British Open to become the first native-born American winner of the Open Championship. Hagen beat his rival Jim Barnes - they battled frequently in PGA Championships - by one stroke at Royal St. George's Golf Club . [PAR] Hagen was born in Rochester, New York. So although he was the first American-born winner, he was also the second consecutive American to win the Open! [PAR] In fact, after Arthur Havers' victory in 1923, the next 10 Open champions were all Americans. They included USA-born golfers Hagen, Bobby Jones , Gene Sarazen and Denny Shute ; and golfers who had acquired American citizenship, Barnes and Tommy Armour .[DOC] [TLE] The Open ChampionshipThe Open Championship, often referred to as The Open or the British Open, is the oldest of the four major championships in professional golf. Held in the United Kingdom, it is administered by The R&A and is the only major outside the United States. The Open is currently the third major of the year, between the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship, and is played in mid-July. [PAR] The current champion is Henrik Stenson, who won the 145th Open at Royal Troon in 2016 with a record-breaking score of \u221220. [PAR] History [PAR] The Open was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Scotland.  The inaugural tournament was restricted to professionals and attracted a field of eight golfers who played three rounds of Prestwick's twelve-hole course in a single day. Willie Park Sr. won with a score of 174, beating Old Tom Morris, by two strokes. The following year the tournament was opened to amateurs; eight of them joined ten professionals in the field.  [PAR] James Ogilvie Fairlie was the principal organiser of the first Open Championship held at Prestwick in 1860. With the untimely death of Allan Robertson, aged 43 in 1859, Prestwick members decided to conduct a challenge the following year that would determine the land\u2019s greatest golfer. In a proposed competition for a \"Challenge Belt\", Fairlie sent out a series of letters to Blackheath, Perth, Edinburgh, Musselburgh and St Andrews, inviting a player known as a \"respectable caddie\" to represent each of the clubs in a tournament to be held on 17 October 1860. [PAR] Originally, the trophy presented to the event's winner was the Challenge Belt, a red leather belt with a silver buckle.

[PAR] Gentle Ben was filmed at Virginia Key, Florida; Africa USA in Acton, California; and Greenwich Studios (a.k.a. Ivan Tors Studios) in Miami, Florida. [PAR] Clint Howard scored pretty big as a child actor. When he grew up, he had the same problem that many child stars do in that audiences and producers found it difficult to accept him in adult roles. Clint was able to land starring adult roles in \"B\" movies, however, and he also played many minor roles in \"A\" movies which were mostly those directed by his brother, \"Ron Howard\" who had also been a child star on the series, \" The Andy Griffith Show \" and then later as a teenager on, \" Happy Days \". [PAR] Many people think that there's some connection between the bear on Gentle Ben and another bear on the series, \" The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams \" because it's also named, \"Ben\". \"Grizzly Adams\" aired ten years after Gentle Ben and had no connection whatsoever with it.

In 1981, he was inducted into the \"Hall of Great Western Performers\" of the \"National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum\". [PAR] When Weaver was first signed on to \"Gunsmoke\", he was a working/but struggling actor. His starting salary was $300 per week which was pretty good money in 1955, but by his last season on the series in 1964, he was earning $9,000 per week! [PAR] Gentle Ben never won any awards.

But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor's appeal into the stratosphere. [PAR] He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life.

But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck. [PAR] Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight.

Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.

[PAR] The circumstances surrounding the death of the rock, blues, and jazz legend Jimi Hendrix remains rather mysterious, and how Hendrix passed away is still a matter of debate.\u00a0 [PAR] Jimi Hendrix's Death [PAR] Some conspiracy theorists contend that Hendrix\u2019s death was the result of a government conspiracy involving his then-girlfriend Monika Dannemann. Other more reasonable explanations include that Hendrix committed suicide, or that he simply asphyxiated after overdosing on barbiturates .\u00a0 [PAR] Jimi Hendrix was a tortured soul and a longtime recreational drug user in spite of his early death at the age of 27. Those who knew Jimi Hendrix have come up with dozens of explanations as to what happened the night of September 18, 1970.\u00a0 Accident, suicide, or murder\u2014how did Jimi Hendrix die?\u00a0 [PAR] Although it may be impossible to know for sure, here are the circumstances, and some of the theories, surrounding the death of rock legend Jimi Hendrix. [PAR] Night of September 17 [PAR] After spending the night at a party with friends, Jimi Hendrix was met by his girlfriend, who planned to take him home. Monika Dannemann, a German figure skater and artist, had been dating Hendrix since they met following one of his concerts.\u00a0 [PAR] They arrived at her apartment in Notting Hill, where they spent the rest of the evening together. Hendrix had enjoyed quite a bit of red wine the night before his death, and in addition to what he had had to drink, the rock star took some of his girlfriend\u2019s sleeping pills.\u00a0 [PAR] Vesperax was a brand with which Hendrix was apparently familiar, but he took far more than the prescribed dose that night\u2014nine full tablets, nearly twenty times the amount that would normally be prescribed by a doctor.\u00a0 [PAR] The next day, his girlfriend woke up to buy a pack of cigarettes, and when she returned sometime around 10:00 am, she found him unresponsive and covered in vomit. Dannemann called an old friend of Hendrix\u2019s, who told her to call an ambulance. Hendrix was found dead at the scene, and the autopsy concluded that he died of asphyxiation sometime shortly after midnight. [PAR] September the 18th [PAR] In spite of these official findings, others have expressed a belief that Hendrix\u2019s death happened very differently. Dannemann\u2019s story has often changed from telling to telling, but according to her, Hendrix was sleeping when she left for cigarettes.\u00a0 When she returned, she found him having difficulty breathing.\u00a0 [PAR] According to Dannemann, Hendrix was alive when he was placed into the back of the ambulance, and he died en route to the hospital. Various versions of this story seem to suggest that those in the ambulance did not properly attend to Hendrix.\u00a0 [PAR] Other versions of the story include that Hendrix was killed by Dannemann (apparently, a scarf was wrapped tightly around his neck when he was placed on the ambulance), and that his manager killed him because Hendrix sought to terminate his contract.\u00a0 [PAR] This latter theory is supported by the doctor who performed the autopsy, who believed the amount of wine found in Hendrix\u2019s body would be impossible for one person to have consumed. Some think his death was a suicide due to a sad poem found written in his hand, and others believe in a government conspiracy to murder the voice of a disillusioned generation. Each of these reports has been refuted by a number of individuals. [PAR] Final Consensus [PAR] It is impossible to say how did Jimi Hendrix died. While the asphyxiation theory reported by the authorities makes the most sense (and can be corroborated on multiple levels), many individuals feel that Hendrix\u2019s death was more suspicious.\u00a0 [PAR] Perhaps the various theories as to how Hendrix died are an attempt to alleviate the sense of betrayal many felt when the rock star died far too young. [PAR] However Jimi Hendrix died, it does not change the fact that he was\u2014and is\u2014one of the most influential and revered individuals in the history of American music.[DOC] [TLE] Death, Drugs & Rock-and-Roll \u2013 www.jimmccluskey.comDeath, Drugs & Rock-and-Roll \u2013\n\n\n### Answer:\n27 </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Wikipedia Born: October 16, 1890, New York City, New York, United States Died: March 31, 1976, Paris, France Period: American modernism Artwork: Wall Street, The Court, New York, more Awards: David Octavius Hill Medal[DOC] [TLE] Paul StrandPaul Strand (October 16, 1890 \u2013 March 31, 1976) was an American photographer and filmmaker who, along with fellow modernist photographers like Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Weston, helped establish photography as an art form in the 20th century. His diverse body of work, spanning six decades, covers numerous genres and subjects throughout the Americas, Europe, and Africa. [PAR] Early modernist work [PAR] Strand was born in New York City to Bohemian parents. In his late teens, he was a student of renowned documentary photographer Lewis Hine at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School. It was while on a fieldtrip in this class that Strand first visited the 291 art gallery \u2013 operated by Stieglitz and Edward Steichen \u2013 where exhibitions of work by forward-thinking modernist photographers and painters would move Strand to take his photographic hobby more seriously. Stieglitz would later promote Strand's work in the 291 gallery itself, in his photography publication Camera Work, and in his artwork in the Hieninglatzing studio. Some of this early work, like the well-known \"Wall Street,\" experimented with formal abstractions (influencing, among others, Edward Hopper and his idiosyncratic urban vision).   Other of Strand's works reflect his interest in using the camera as a tool for social reform. He was one of the founders of the Photo League, an association of photographers who advocated using their art to promote social and political causes. [PAR] Film-making [PAR] Over the next few decades, Strand worked in motion pictures as well as still photography. His first film was Manhatta (1921), also known as New York the Magnificent, a silent film showing the day-to-day life of New York City made with painter/photographer Charles Sheeler. Manhatta includes a shot similar to Strand's famous Wall Street (1915) photograph. In 1932\u201335, he lived in Mexico and worked on Redes (1936), a film commissioned by the Mexican government, released in the US as The Wave.  Other films he was involved with were the documentary The Plow That Broke the Plains (1936)  and the pro-union, anti-fascist Native Land (1942). [PAR] France [PAR] In June 1949, Strand left the United States to present Native Land at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in Czechoslovakia. The remaining 27 years of his life were spent in Orgeval, France, where, despite never learning the language, he maintained an impressive, creative life, assisted by his third wife, fellow photographer Hazel Kingsbury Strand. [PAR] Although Strand is best known for his early abstractions, his return to still photography in this later period produced some of his most significant work in the form of six book \"portraits\" of place: Time in New England (1950), La France de Profil (1952), Un Paese (featuring photographs of Luzzara and the Po River Valley in Italy, Einaudi, 1955), Tir a'Mhurain / Outer Hebrides  (1962), Living Egypt (1969, with James Aldridge) and Ghana: An African Portrait (with commentary by Basil Davidson; London: Gordon Fraser, 1976).

The group was initially composed of brothers Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Managed by the Wilsons' father Murry, The Beach Boys signed to Capitol Records in 1962. The band's early music gained popularity across the United States for its close vocal harmonies and lyrics reflecting a Southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. By the mid 1960s, Brian Wilson's growing creative ambition and songwriting ability would dominate the group's musical direction. The primarily Wilson-composed Pet Sounds album and \"Good Vibrations\" single (both released in 1966) featured a complex, intricate and multi-layered sound that was a far cry from the simple surf rock of The Beach Boys' early years. [PAR] However, Wilson would soon lose control of the band due to mental-health and substance-abuse issues. Subsequently, although it released a number of popular albums (in various musical styles, with different line-ups) in ensuing years, the group never managed to reclaim its mid-'60s peak when The Beach Boys briefly challenged The Beatles both in terms of commercial and critical appeal. Since the 1980s, there has been much legal-wrangling among the group members over royalties, songwriting credits, and use of the band's name. While The Beach Boys released their last studio album in 1996, a number of versions of the band, each fronted by a surviving member of the original quintet (Dennis and Carl Wilson died in 1983 and 1998, respectively), continue to tour. [PAR] The Beach Boys have often been called \"America's Band\", and Allmusic has stated that \"the band's unerring ability... made them America's first, best rock band.\" The group has had 36 United States Top 40 hits (the most by an American rock band) and 56 Hot 100 hits, including four number-one singles.[2] Rolling Stone magazine listed The Beach Boys at number 12 on their 2004 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". The core quintet of the three Wilsons, Love and Jardine was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. [PAR] In the autumn of 1961, cousins Brian Wilson and Mike Love composed a song on surfing, titled \"Surfin'\" at the behest of Brian's younger sibling, Dennis Wilson. They quickly formed a band, bringing in youngest Wilson brother Carl on lead guitar and Brian's high school friend Al Jardine on rhythm guitar. Brian took up bass, Dennis the drums and Mike would be the frontman, while they all would harmonize vocals arranged by Brian. Released that December, produced by Hite & Dorinda Morgan, and backed by the rarest Beach Boys' B-side, \"Luau\", \"Surfin'\" made #75 in the US Top 100 in early 1962. [PAR] Father Murry Wilson became the band's manager. He submitted a professionally-recorded demo tape to Capitol Records that spring. The Beach Boys were signed and \"Surfin' Safari\" b/w \"409\" (from the April 1962 demo tape) was released as a single that June. Al Jardine left the band before the demo session, to be replaced by a friend of Carl's, David Marks, until the fall of 1963. [PAR] With both \"Surfin' Safari\" and \"409\" becoming hits (the former reaching US #14), Capitol Records approved a full album. Brian Wilson, who regularly collaborated with Mike Love and Gary Usher, contributed the songs that made up the bulk of the LP.

[PAR] The Who [PAR] Although already a big act in the UK, and now gaining some attention in the US after playing some New York dates two months earlier, The Who were propelled into the American mainstream at Monterey. At the end of their frenetic performance of \"My Generation\", the audience were stunned as guitarist Pete Townshend began smashing his guitar, amid smoke bombs and frightened concert staff rushing onstage to scurry expensive microphones to safety. At the end of the mayhem, drummer Keith Moon kicked over his drum kit as the band exited the stage. The Who, after winning a coin toss, performed before Jimi Hendrix, as Townshend and Hendrix each refused to go on after the other - both having planned an instrument-demolishing conclusion to their respective sets. [PAR] The Jimi Hendrix Experience [PAR] Hendrix ended his Monterey performance with an unpredictable version of \"Wild Thing\", which he capped by kneeling over his guitar, pouring lighter fluid over it, setting it aflame, and then smashing it in to the stage seven times before throwing its remains into the audience. This produced unforeseen sounds and these actions contributed to his rising popularity in the USA. [PAR] Janis Joplin [PAR] Monterey Pop was also one of the earliest major public performances for Janis Joplin, who appeared as a member of Big Brother and The Holding Company. Joplin was seen swigging from a bottle of Southern Comfort as she gave a provocative rendition of the song \"Ball 'n' Chain\". Columbia Records signed Big Brother and The Holding Company on the basis of their performance at Monterey. [PAR] Otis Redding [PAR] Redding, backed by Booker T. & The MG's, was included on the bill through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler, who saw the festival as an opportunity to advance Redding's career. Up until that point, Redding had performed mainly for black audiences, besides a few successful shows at the Whisky a Go Go. Redding's show, received well by the audience (\"there is certainly more audible crowd participation in Redding's set than in any of the others filmed by Pennebaker that weekend\") included \"Respect\" and a version of \"Satisfaction\".

Taylor , University of Georgia, [PAR] 08/15/2003 [PAR] Last edited by  NGE Staff  on 10/12/2016 [PAR] Georgia's peach industry has a long tradition. The first peaches were planted in the state in the eighteenth century, [PAR] Peaches [PAR] and the first commercial production occurred in the mid-nineteenth century. In 2014 Georgia ranked third nationally in peach production, behind California and South Carolina. That year, Georgia produced 35,500 tons of peaches.\u00a0 [PAR] Franciscan monks introduced peaches to St. Simons and Cumberland islands along Georgia's coast in 1571. By the mid-1700s peaches and plums were cultivated by the Cherokee Indians . Before the Civil War (1861-65) increasing [PAR] Peach Harvest [PAR] numbers of home orchards also were planted. Raphael Moses , a planter and Confederate officer from Columbus , was among the first to market peaches within Georgia in 1851 and is credited with being the first to ship and sell peaches successfully outside of the South. His method of shipping peaches in champagne baskets, rather than in pulverized charcoal, helped to preserve the flavor of the fruit and contributed to his success. Peach acreage expanded considerably\u00a0in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, resulting in an all-time high production of almost 8 million bushels by 1928. Since then production has decreased to about 2.6 million bushels annually. [PAR] Georgia enjoys important production and marketing advantages, primarily its proximity to eastern markets and favorable prices because of early harvests and high-quality fruit production. Nearly all peaches grown in Georgia are sold in the wholesale fresh market, with a small percentage sold at roadside markets. There is no significant peach processing in Georgia. [PAR] The first Georgia peaches were shipped to the New York market between 1858 and 1860. They were transported by wagon to Augusta , then by shallow-draft boat to Savannah , and finally by steamship to New York. Georgia earned its \"Peach State\" designation during the three decades following the Civil War. [PAR] Peach expansion in acreage and production was fueled by several factors. The abolition of slavery forced farmers to search for alternatives to the traditional labor-intensive cotton crop. Peaches in particular benefited from this transition. In 1870 Samuel H. Rumph, a Marshallville peach grower, [PAR] Thomaston Peaches, ca. 1920 [PAR] discovered a new peach variety, which he named Elberta for his wife. This yellow-fleshed peach was of superior quality and shipped better than previous varieties. Elberta remained the leading peach in Georgia until 1960, but newer varieties, for example J. H. Hale and Belle, have since replaced the Elberta in commercial use. (Georgia now produces more than forty commercial varieties.) [PAR] Improvements in rail transportation and the development of the refrigerated rail car by Rumph allowed rapid shipments to northern markets on a large scale. Also the Georgia State Horticultural Society, founded near Augusta in 1876, promoted the introduction and testing of many fruit varieties and their distribution throughout the state while under the leadership of Prosper J. A. Berckmans, a nurseryman and pomologist. The old Berckmans Nursery is now the site of the Augusta National Golf Club, home to the annual Masters Tournament . [PAR] Georgia Peach Orchard [PAR] counties along the fall line , the transition zone between Georgia's Piedmont and Coastal Plain . This area is far enough north to receive sufficient winter chilling, but far enough south to avoid late frosts and guarantee early harvest dates. The early harvest allows premium prices for the crop. Additionally, the sandy loam soils of the fall line are more favorable to peach production than the Piedmont's heavy clays or the Coastal Plain's sands. [PAR] There is a small commercial presence in Brooks and Pierce counties in south Georgia, where new varieties suitable for those areas are improving fruit quality. The new varieties seem to be responsible for a surge in the planting of peaches in this region of the state. Historically, considerable peach production occurred in north Georgia also, but during the 1980s and 1990s acreage declined because of frequent freeze damage and relatively late harvest dates.

[PAR] ~Albert Einstein [PAR] If you\u2019ve ever seen a Ken Burns documentary, you\u2019re familiar with their use of faded photos, archival video and interviews with renowned historians. Films like \u201cThe Civil War,\u201d \u201cThomas Jefferson\u201d and \u201cLewis & Clark\u201d bring the past to life despite the decades of distance between the subject matter and the viewers. No doubt, his newest documentary, \u201c Prohibition ,\u201d which premieres Sunday at 8 p.m. PBS, promises to offer a thorough historical examination of American life during the period around the 18th Amendment\u2019s rise and fall. \u00a0The three-part series focusing on Prohibition\u2019s past, however, may lead the viewers to believe that every aspect of it ended a long time ago. Unfortunately, that is not the case. [PAR] The documentary notes, \u201c[P]rohibition turned law-abiding citizens into criminals, and criminals into kings,\u201d \u201cIt made a mockery of the justice system, caused illicit drinking to seem glamorous and fun, encouraged neighborhood gangs to become national crime syndicates, permitted government officials to bend and sometimes even break the law\u2026\u201d Unfortunately that is still the case today. The regulatory scheme enacted to \u201csafely reintroduce\u201d alcohol into society following Prohibition\u2019s repeal has grown into a labyrinth of state-based rules, resulting in a number of negative consequences \u2014 many similar to those of Prohibition. [PAR] Many readers may balk at that, and ask \u201cSure, we\u2019ve got some blue laws here and there, but how bad could it be?\u201d Examining the regulations on the sale of just one type of alcoholic beverage, beer, makes it clear that significant remnants of Prohibition and even the temperance movement are still with us today \u2014strangling small businesses, protecting cartels and making criminals out of honest citizens. [PAR] The strongest remnant of Prohibition that has endured beyond the repeal of a federal ban on the manufacture and sale of alcohol is the symbiotic relationship between moralizing teetotalers and business cartels \u2014 a phenomenon economist Bruce Yandle dubbed \u201cBootleggers and Baptists,\u201d whereby two dissimilar groups with conflicting ideologies share the same policy goals. Baptists and other religious groups wished to ban the sale of alcohol in order to help people live what they considered pious lives. Bootleggers, on the other hand, wanted a ban because they knew demand for alcohol would remain and they would be able to supply that alcohol at an increased price and with little competition. [PAR] The cast of characters has changed in the ensuing years, but the symbiotic relationship between Bootleggers and Baptists persists, as there are still two major groups that, despite differing principles, have the same goal of restricting alcohol markets. There is a third party though, one that always loses out in this drama: consumers and entrepreneurs, who pay for all this in higher prices and loss of freedom. [PAR] Utah and Modern day Baptists [PAR] Prior to the 18th Amendment\u2019s ratification, one of the most powerful temperance group was the Anti-Saloon League (ASL). Comprised primarily of Methodists and Baptists, the ASL was extremely adept at leveraging its congregation-based grassroots in national political campaigns. They threw their support behind \u201cdry\u201d candidates in elections and crushed the efforts of \u201cwet\u201d lawmakers. Eventually, the ASL even supported regulators in their efforts to enact a personal income tax. In return, those pro-tax politicians, such as Andrew J. Volstead, became powerful allies of the temperance movement. In modern Utah, it is the non-drinking Mormon population that lawmakers court. [PAR] In 2008, Mormons made up around 60 percent of Utah\u2019s population. Utah politicians try to appeal to them as the largest voting group in the state. Most lawmakers have learned a lesson or two from Prohibition and have found ways to support the temperance cause without immediately alienating their imbibing constituents. Rather than try to ban alcohol, modern \u201cdry\u201d lawmakers promote policies restricting the sale, consumption or manufacturing of alcohol under the guise of \u201cpublic safety\u201d or \u201cpublic health.\u201d Usually, they claim regulations\n\n\n### Answer:\nutah </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] IN THESE GROUPS [PAR] Famous People Named Connors [PAR] Synopsis [PAR] Born on September 2, 1952, in East St. Louis, Illinois, Jimmy Connors learned to play tennis from his mother, a former pro. The gritty left-hander leaped to prominence in 1974, using his overpowering two-handed backhand stroke to win three Grand Slam tournaments. Connors ended his career with a men's open\u2013era record 109 singles titles and 1,337 victories, along with eight Grand Slam singles titles. [PAR] Early Years [PAR] James Scott Connors Jr. was born on September 2, 1952, in East St. Louis, Illinois, to James Sr. and Gloria Connors. A former professional tennis player, Gloria cleared land behind their house to build a court when she was pregnant with her younger son. Along with her mother, Bertha Thompson, known as \"Two Mom,\" Gloria taught Connors what would become his feared two-handed backhand shot and instilled in him a ferocious competitive drive. [PAR] At 16, Connors began training with erstwhile champion Pancho Segura. He enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles, for one year and won the NCAA singles title, then dropped out to turn professional. [PAR] Professional Career [PAR] Connors quickly developed a reputation as a maverick among his peers. He refused to join the Association of Tennis Professionals union, opting to play in independent tournaments organized by his manager, Bill Riordan. He also became known for spewing profanities on the court, shocking the fans of what was considered a gentleman's game, and was mocked for his close relationship with his mother. [PAR] However, there was no denying his ability to pulverize a tennis ball with the unusual steel racket he favored. Connors leapt into public view when he outlasted former Wimbledon champion Arthur Ashe in five sets to win the U.S. Pro Singles title in 1973. The left-hander had a season for the ages in 1974, winning the three Grand Slam tournaments he entered (Australian Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open) and accumulating a staggering overall 99-4 record in match play. He became the sport's No. 1-ranked male player that July, a distinction he held for 159 consecutive weeks. [PAR] Over the next decade, Connors continued to dominate opponents with his deadly service return and two-handed backhand. He won four more U.S. Open singles titles\u2014on three different surfaces\u2014as well as the 1982 Wimbledon men's championship. He also claimed several \"winner take all\" matches against contemporary stars such as Ilie Nastase and aging champions such as Rod Laver. [PAR] The gritty veteran earned his final tournament victory in 1989, at the Tel Aviv Open, but his last hurrah in the spotlight came during the 1991 U.S. Open. Connors rallied from two sets down against Patrick McEnroe in the first round and again against Aaron Krickstein in the fourth, on his 39th birthday, before falling to Jim Courier in the semifinals. [PAR] Connors played one more full season in 1992 and his final ATP match in 1996, though he never officially retired from the sport. In addition to his men's open\u2013era record 109 singles titles and 1,337 victories, Connors accumulated eight Grand Slam singles and two more doubles championships. He held the No. 1 ranking for a total of 268 weeks in his career, and at one point was ranked in the top 10 for an amazing 16 consecutive years. [PAR] Personal Life [PAR] Connors dated American tennis star Chris Evert in the early 1970s, but they called off their engagement in November 1974. Connors later married former Playboy Playmate Patti McGuire, with whom he has two children, Brett and Aubree. [PAR] The hard-hitting champion was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1998. In January 2007, his beloved mother died at the age of 82.

In the UK, she was a star as a singer and as a television performer, where she was a regular on the BBC. In the early '60s, she also caught on in France when she started recording her songs in French. Oddly, she didn't get an American record deal until late in 1964 when a Warner Bros. executive named Joe Smith, who was vacationing in England, heard the song and signed her to a deal. [PAR] When \"Downtown\" was released in the US, it shot to #1, making Petula the first female singer from the UK to hit #1 in the US during the rock era (after 1955). Remarkably, she didn't even promote the song before it hit the top spot, as she was touring French-speaking countries at the time. \"The Ed Sullivan Show had been calling every day while I was on tour in Canada saying, 'You've got to get here,'\" Petula told us. \"I couldn't get there. Eventually I got there, and the record was #1.\" (Here's our full Petula Clark interview .) [PAR] On the surface, this song is about having a delightful time during a trip downtown. But what happens when the night is over and the singer returns to her everyday life? After all, the trip into the city is merely an escape. [PAR] While many listeners don't process the song on this level, Petula does. An accomplished actress, she thinks of her songs as \"mini movies\" when she performs them, and considers the feelings behind them. This song, to her, isn't so chipper. \"I've always thought there was this loneliness and there's even a slight feeling of desperation in it,\" she told us. [PAR] A British songwriter and producer named Tony Hatch wrote this. During the '60s, he wrote most of Clark's material, including her follow-up hit \"I Know a Place\" (which also dealt with city life). Hatch was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2013. [PAR] Does Petula envision a specific downtown when she performs this song?

It has been held at the All England Club in Wimbledon, London since 1877.  [PAR] Wimbledon is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, the others being the Australian Open, the French Open and the US Open. Since the Australian Open shifted to hardcourt in 1988, Wimbledon is the only major still played on grass. [PAR] The tournament takes place over two weeks in late June and early July, culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Final, scheduled always for the second Saturday and Sunday of July respectively. Five major, junior, and invitational events are held each year. Wimbledon traditions include a strict dress code for competitors and Royal patronage. The tournament is also notable for the absence of sponsor advertising around the courts. In 2009, Wimbledon's Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain. [PAR] History [PAR] Beginning [PAR] The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club is a private club founded on 23 July 1868, originally as \"The All England Croquet Club\". Its first ground was off Worple Road, Wimbledon.  [PAR] In 1876, lawn tennis, a game devised by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield a year or so earlier and originally given the name Sphairistik\u00e8, was added to the activities of the club. In spring 1877, the club was renamed \"The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club\" and signalled its change of name by instituting the first Lawn Tennis Championship. A new code of laws, replacing the code administered by the Marylebone Cricket Club, was drawn up for the event. Today's rules are similar except for details such as the height of the net and posts and the distance of the service line from the net. [PAR] The inaugural 1877 Wimbledon Championship opened on 9 July 1877. The Gentlemen's Singles was the only event held and was won by Spencer Gore, an old Harrovian rackets player, from a field of 22. About 200 spectators paid one shilling each to watch the final.  [PAR] The lawns at the ground were arranged so that the principal court was in the middle with the others arranged around it, hence the title \"Centre Court\". The name was retained when the Club moved in 1922 to the present site in Church Road, although no longer a true description of its location. However, in 1980 four new courts were brought into commission on the north side of the ground, which meant the Centre Court was once more correctly defined. The opening of the new No. 1 Court in 1997 emphasised the description. [PAR] By 1882, activity at the club was almost exclusively confined to lawn tennis and that year the word \"croquet\" was dropped from the title. However, for sentimental reasons it was restored in 1899. [PAR] In 1884, the club added Ladies' Singles and Gentlemen's Doubles competitions. Ladies' Doubles and Mixed Doubles events were added in 1913. Until 1922, the reigning champion had to play only in the final, against whomever had won through to challenge him/her. As with the other three Major or Grand Slam events, Wimbledon was contested by top-ranked amateur players, professional players were prohibited from participating. This changed with the advent of the open era in 1968. No British man won the singles event at Wimbledon between Fred Perry in 1936 and Andy Murray in 2013, while no British woman has won since Virginia Wade in 1977, although Annabel Croft and Laura Robson won the Girls' Championship in 1984 and 2008 respectively. The Championship was first televised in 1937. [PAR] Though properly called \"The Championships, Wimbledon\", depending on sources the event is also known as \"The All England Lawn Tennis Championships\", \"The Wimbledon Championships\" or simply \"Wimbledon\". From 1912 to 1924, the tournament was recognized by the International Lawn Tennis Federation as the \"World Grass Court Championships\".

Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse around 1970 when illness overtook his life for more than a decade. [PAR] Things finally started to change in the early'80s. David met Gillian and within a year made a triumphant return to the world of classical piano. [PAR] In 1996, Shine, inspired by David's life made a tremendous impact on audiences and his life.

His talk is obsessive chatter, looping back on itself, seizing on words and finding nonsense associations for them. He laughs a lot and seems desperately affable. When he sits down at a piano in a crowded restaurant, he looks like trouble, until he starts to play. His music floods out like a cry of anguish and hope. [PAR] Advertisement [PAR] This is the central image in Scott Hicks ' \u201cShine,\u201d based on the true story of an Australian pianist who was an international prodigy, suffered a breakdown and has gradually been able to piece himself back together. The musician's name is David Helfgott. His life story is not exactly as it is shown here, but close enough, I gather, for us to marvel at the way the human spirit can try to heal itself. [PAR] The movie circles in time, using three actors to play Helfgott. Alex Rafalowicz is young David, encouraged to excel at music and chess by a domineering father who slams the chessboard and shouts, \u201cYou must always win!\u201d He is savage when his son places second in a national competition. Noah Taylor , so good in \u201c Flirting ,\u201d plays the adolescent David, who blossoms at the piano, but is forbidden by his father to accept a scholarship offered by violin great Isaac Stern. Geoffrey Rush plays David as an adult who goes mad and then slowly heals with the help of an understanding woman. [PAR] But it is all so much more complicated than this makes it sound. We should begin with David's father, Peter ( Armin Mueller-Stahl ), a Polish Jew who survived the Holocaust but lost most of his family. Now resettled in Australia, he places family above everything; refusing to let David study at the Royal College of Music in London, he screams, \u201cYou will destroy your family!\u201d Peter is capable of violence but also tenderness and love; his family is in the grip of his tyranny, and it is little wonder that David comes unglued, torn between his father's demands that he be perfect at the piano, and his refusal to let him follow his musical career where it will lead. [PAR] Advertisement [PAR] David finds friendship and support from an old woman (Googie Withers), who encourages his music and helps him find the courage to go to London, where his tutor is played wonderfully, with dryness and affection, by John Gielgud . There he is happy for a time, but during a performance of the formidable Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3, David comes apart. [PAR] We see him next as a middle-aged man, a wanderer back in Australia, talking nonsense, his name forgotten by all but a few. (I understand that Scott Hicks got the idea for this film when he came across Helfgott playing in a restaurant and heard his story.) One of the buried motifs of \u201cShine\u201d is the war that goes on between David's parent-figures. His father is a monster and his mother is weak, but the old woman in Perth helps him, and so does a piano teacher (Nicholas Bell).

[PAR] The Marshall Plan was a massive program of aid from the United States to sixteen western and southern European countries aimed at helping economic renewal and strengthening democracy after the devastation of World War 2. It was started in 1948 and was officially known as the European Recovery Program, or ERP, but is more commonly known as the Marshall Plan, after the man who announced it, US Secretary of State George C. Marshall . [PAR] The Need for Aid: [PAR] The Second World War severely damaged the economies of Europe, leaving many in a parlous state: cities and factories had been bombed, transport links had been severed and agricultural production disrupted. Populations had been moved, or destroyed, and a tremendous amount of capital had been spent on weapons and related products. It's not an exaggeration to say the continent was a wreck. In 1946 Britain, a former world power, was close to bankruptcy and had to pull out of international agreements, while in France and Italy there was inflation and unrest and the fear of starvation. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] The Marshall Plan [PAR] Communist parties across the continent were benefiting from this economic turmoil, and this raised the chance Stalin could conquer the west through elections and revolutions instead of having lost the chance when Allied troops pushed the Nazis back east. It looked like the defeat of the Nazis might cause the loss of the European markets for decades. Several ideas to aid the rebuilding of Europe had been proposed, from inflicting harsh reparations on Germany - a plan that had been tried after World War One and which appeared to have failed utterly to bring peace so wasn't used again - to the US giving aid and recreating someone to trade with. [PAR] The Marshall Plan: [PAR] The US, also terrified that communist groups would gain further power \u2013 the Cold War was emerging and Soviet domination of Europe seemed a real danger - and wishing to secure European markets, opted for a programme of financial aid. Announced on June 5th 1947 by George Marshall , the European Recovery Program, ERP, called for a system of aid and loans, at first to all nations affected by the war. However, as plans for the ERP were being formalised Russian leader Stalin, afraid of US economic domination, refused the initiative and pressured the nations under his control into refusing aid despite a desperate need. [PAR] The Marshall Plan in Action: [PAR] Once a committee of sixteen countries reported back favourably the Programme was signed into US law on April 3, 1948. The Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) was then created under Paul G. Hoffman, and between then and 1952 over $13 billion worth of aid was given. To assist in co-ordinating the Programme the European nations created the Committee of European Economic Cooperation which helped form a four year recovery programme. [PAR] The nations receiving were: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom and West Germany. [PAR] Effects of the Marshall Plan: [PAR] During the years of the plan receiving nations experienced an economic growth of between 15% - 25%. Industry was quickly renewed and agricultural production sometimes exceeded pre-war levels. This boom helped push communist groups away from power and created an economic divide between the rich west and poor communist east as clear as the political one. The shortage of foreign currency was also alleviated allowing for more imports. [PAR] Views of the Marshall Plan: [PAR] Winston Churchill described the plan as \u201cthe most unselfish act by any great power in history\u201d and many have been happy to stay with this altruistic impression. However, some commentators have accused the United States of practicing a form of economic imperialism, tying the western nations of Europe to them just as the Soviet Union dominated the east, partly because acceptance into the plan required those nations to be open to US markets, partly because a great deal of the aid was used to purchase imports\n\n\n### Answer:\neuropean recovery program </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Two hundred years                                           ago, Vienna became Europe\u2019s political, cultural, and social hub for a period of several months. The Congress was hosted by                                           Emperor Francis I of Austria. All of the major European powers sent their delegates in order to confer about how to reorganise                                           the continent, which had lost its stability during the Napoleonic Wars. Austria was represented by the Prince of Metternich,                                           who also functioned as the president of the Congress. The declared goal was to achieve peace in Europe through a balance of                                           powers and thus secure order on a long-term basis. The diplomatic negotiations were accompanied by a number of social events                                           and entertainments, the enormous splendour of which has been captured in numerous written and pictorial documents. In those                                           days, Vienna was flourishing as a centre of cultural life, with many artists coming to the imperial city and inspiring all                                           genres of domestic art production. [PAR] Europe in Vienna - The Congress of Vienna 1814/15 will be on view at                                           the Lower Belvedere and the Orangery from 20 February to 21 June 2015. The comprehensive exhibition will highlight both the                                           political and social aspects of this extraordinary event, which kept all Europe on tenterhooks over several months. [PAR] There                                           is hardly another political, diplomatic and social event of the nineteenth century that was documented by such a great diversity                                           of materials like the Congress of Vienna, which turned the metropolis on the River Danube into the hotspot of Europe for a                                           brief period of time. Preparing the objects for the exhibition confronted the curators Sabine Grabner and Werner Telesko with                                           the challenge of vividly presenting a diplomatic and historical process that is mainly perceived as a social event. The exhibits                                           range from reportage prints and caricatures to history paintings and portraits in various dimensions and media \u2013 from miniature                                           to sculpture and life-sized oil paintings. The scope of the Congress of Vienna as a phenomenon of social and artistic ramifications                                           is to be displayed in the form of masterpieces from all genres.

The borderlines between the individual European                                           powers were redefined on a long-term basis. Especially the power equilibrium that had been reached in Vienna had a far-reaching                                           impact on the entire continent. Peaceful negotiations helped settle a number of conflicting interests and tensions. For almost                                           forty years, no further martial conflicts occurred on a European level, due to the stability that had been brought about.                                           Initially, Russia, Austria, Prussia, and Great Britain had decided that France, Spain, and the lesser powers should not have                                           a voice in the decision processes. Yet the experienced French diplomat Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand eventually succeeded                                           in getting France to participate in the deliberations of the major powers. \u2018You have come in time to see great things happen.

The two battled back and forth for the lead, and entering the final series of the season on September 25, were tied at 65 home runs. Sosa hit a 462 foot home run off Houston Astros pitcher Jose Lima for his 66th home run of the season. McGwire, however, while the Cardinals hosted the Montreal Expos, hit five home runs against five different pitchers, setting the record at 70 with a 370 foot home run off Carl Pavano.[DOC] [TLE] Mark McGwire 's Seventy Home Run Season by Baseball AlmanacMark McGwire's Seventy Home Run Season by Baseball Almanac [PAR] Support [PAR] 70 Single Season Home Runs by Mark McGwire [PAR] Mark McGwire had been known throughout his career as a great home run hitter. In 1998, he changed the record books as the whole world watched. He, and Chicago Cub Sammy Sosa, brought back memories of the 1961 Mickey Mantle / Roger Maris home run race. McGwire eventually \"won\" by hitting the record breaking sixty-second homer seven days before Sosa. McGwire went around the bases eight more times before season's end, leaving the new record at seventy. [PAR] McGwire began going over the fence as early as March. He hit consistently through the summer, jockeying for the National League lead with Sosa. The two faced a mass of media, as every eye in the country turned to see who would win the place in the record books. On September 8, McGwire did just that as he hit an 88 mile per hour fastball off of Steve Trachsel of the Chicago Cubs. Sosa was there to celebrate the milestone; he celebrated his own five days later. McGwire and Sosa capped their seasons as the co-holders of Sports Illustrated's Sportsmen of the Year. [PAR] McGwire later admitted to using the steroid Androstenedione during his record setting year, among others. Since his retirement in 2001, McGwire has kept a low profile, marrying the following April.

That was fine with the proud Papa, and Otto encouraged Woody as he appeared in Vaudeville as a child singer and tap-dancer. However, at the age 11 Woody picked up a saxophone and clarinet and saw the direction his life would go. Within four years he was playing professionally. [PAR] After playing in the early 30's with outfits like the Tom Gerun band and the Harry Sosnik orchestra, Woody joined the Isham Jones Orchestra in 1934. Jones was recording for Decca at the time, and became convinced that he could live comfortably off his residuals. With Jones bowing out, Woody saw an opportunity to lead his own outfit. [PAR] The group stayed with Decca, mostly recording covers of other Decca acts in a blues format. In fact, they were often billed as \u201cThe Band That Plays the Blues\u201d. In time, they developed a unique style and in 1939 recorded \u201cWoodchopper's Ball\u201d which would go on to be Herman's biggest hit. The Band That Plays the Blues is featured in this collection in the 1940 remote broadcast from New York's Famous Door club. [PAR] In 1942, Herman hired bebop trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie to write a series of arrangements. This was seen as a pivotal point, not only for Woody Herman's sound but Jazz as a whole. Swing, with its easily danceable melodies was falling from popularity in favor of a style which demanded to be listened to rather than danced to. After a series of personnel changes the band became Woody Herman's Herd. Heavily influenced by Duke Ellington \u00a0and Count Basie, the Herd was known for lively arrangements that combined swing rhythms and bebop themes. [PAR] The Woody Herman Show began broadcasting on ABC (and rebroadcasting over AFRS) in the fall of 1945.

[PAR] In time, the band evolved into a Second and Third Herd, and a New Thundering Herd. By the 70's, Herman began dedicating himself to Jazz education and developing new artists, earning the nickname \u201cRoad Father\u201d. Woody continued to perform into the 1980s, largely because he owed millions in back taxes due to a business manager's bookkeeping error.

[PAR] Share Tweet [PAR] Bungee jumping is a recreational sport which involves jumping off from an elevated platform while tied with a big elastic cord. The platform may usually be a fixed object, like any building, tower or bridge, or it may as well be a moving object too, like a hot air balloon or even a helicopter. One end of the elastic cord is tied with the jumper\u2019s body while the other one with the platform. The elastic cord is designed in such a way that it stretches during the jumper\u2019s fall and then rebound repeatedly until all the energy from free fall washed-out. The thrill of this dangerous sport which is coming from the free-fall as much as rebound, made over 2 million people so far to perform the activity since its inception in 1955.

Garbo was nominated three times for the Academy Award for Best Actress and received an honorary one in 1954 for her \"luminous and unforgettable screen performances.\" In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Garbo fifth on their list of the greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood Cinema, after Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Audrey Hepburn, and Ingrid Bergman. [PAR] Garbo launched her career with a secondary role in the 1924 Swedish film The Saga of Gosta Berling. Her performance caught the attention of Louis B. Mayer, chief executive of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), who brought her to Hollywood in 1925. She immediately stirred interest with her first silent film, Torrent, released in 1926; a year later, her performance in Flesh and the Devil, her third movie, made her an international star.

Though exact numbers remain unconfirmed, it is believed that as many as 500 people including women, children and the elderly were killed in the My Lai Massacre.. Higher-ranking U.S. Army officers managed to cover up the events of that day for a year before revelations by a soldier who had heard of the massacre sparked a wave of international outrage and led to a special investigation into the matter. In 1970, a U.S. Army board charged 14 officers of crimes related to the events at My Lai; only one was convicted. The brutality of the My Lai killings and the extent of the cover-up exacerbated growing antiwar sentiment on the home front in the United States and further divided the nation over the continuing American presence in Vietnam. [PAR] Google [PAR] Massacre at My Lai [PAR] The My Lai hamlet, part of the village of Son My, was located in Quang Ngai province, which was believed to be a stronghold of the National Liberation Front (NLF) or Viet Cong (VC) and was a frequent target of U.S. and South Vietnamese bombing attacks. In March 1968, Charlie Company of the Americal Division\u2019s 11th Infantry Brigade received word that VC guerrillas had taken control of Son My. Led by Lieutenant William L. Calley, the unit was sent to the village on a search-and-destroy mission on March 16. At the time, morale among U.S. soldiers on the ground was dwindling, especially in the wake of the North Vietnamese-led Tet Offensive , which was launched on January 31 1968. Charlie Company had lost some 28 of its members to death or injuries, and was down to just over 100 men. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] Hugh Thompson, the helicopter pilot who stopped the My Lai massacre, later told the news program \"60 Minutes\" that he received death threats upon his return from Vietnam. In March 1998, 30 years after the events at My Lai, the U.S. Army presented Thompson and two members of his crew with the Soldier's Medal, for heroism not involving conflict with an enemy. [PAR] Army commanders had advised the soldiers of Charlie Company that all who were found in Son My could be considered VC or active VC sympathizers, and ordered them to destroy the village. When they arrived, the soldiers found no Viet Cong, but rounded up and murdered hundreds of civilians\u2013mostly women, children and old men\u2013in an extremely brutal fashion, including rape and torture. Calley was reported to have dragged dozens of people, including young children, into a ditch before executing them with a machine gun. Not a single shot was fired against the men of Charlie Company at My Lai. [PAR] Cover-Up of the My Lai Massacre [PAR] The My Lai massacre reportedly ended only after Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson, an Army helicopter pilot on a reconnaissance mission, landed his aircraft between the soldiers and the retreating villagers and threatened to open fire if they continued their attacks. Knowing news of the massacre would cause a scandal, officers higher up in command of Charlie Company and the 11th Brigade immediately made efforts to downplay the bloodshed. The coverup continued until Ron Ridenhour, a soldier in the 11th Brigade who had heard reports of the massacre but had not participated, began a campaign to bring the events to light. After writing letters to President Richard Nixon, the Pentagon , State Department, Joint Chiefs of Staff and several congressmen, with no response, Ridenhour finally gave an interview to the investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, who broke the story in November 1969. [PAR] Amid the international uproar that followed Ridenhour\u2019s revelations, the U.S. Army ordered a special investigation into the My Lai massacre and subsequent efforts to cover it up.

[An earlier unsuccessful attempt                   at a sequel-Best Picture win was The Bells of St. Mary's                     (1945) - following the Best Picture winner of the previous                   year - Going My Way (1944).

Some might consider                   the Best Picture-winning The Silence                     of the Lambs (1991) as a sequel to Manhunter                       (1986) , but that stretches the definition of a true                   sequel.] [PAR] It also accomplished a marvelous feat - it did exceptionally well with double the total number of Oscars                   than its predecessor - with eleven nominations and six wins                   (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Robert                   DeNiro), Best Screenplay Adaptation, Best Art Direction/Set                   Decoration, and Best Original Dramatic Score (by Nino Rota                   and the director's own father Carmine Coppola)).

[PAR] Five of its six un-rewarded nominations were                   for acting roles.

With his new honors in 1974, he                     would add three more awards: Best Picture (as producer),                     Best Director, and Best Screenplay Adaptation (again shared                     with Mario Puzo). It was an unprecedented win for Coppola                     - three Oscars for writing, producing, and directing                     the same film.] [PAR] (Note: A triple win had also occurred for Leo McCarey                     in 1944, Billy Wilder in 1960, James L.

Robert Aldrich's grotesque gothic tragedy is a cross between Gypsy, with its antithetical show-biz kid sisters, and Sunset Boulevard, with its decayed Hollywood glamour.

She's self-centered and more selfish than her plain sister, Blanche, who in the 1930s becomes a queen of Hollywood melodrama. Then it seems as if Jane, in a sudden fit of drunken jealousy, has rammed her car into her sister and crippled her for life. Years later, the sisters are still living together in a nightmare of mutually destructive co-dependency. [PAR] Director Aldrich is no stranger to movies about Hollywood or the grotesque. His best-known works \u2014 including Kiss Me Deadly, The Dirty Dozen and The Longest Yard \u2014 range from film noir and horror to biblical epic and archetypal action films.

It featured a long-running romance between a reserved      Britisher and confirmed bachelor (Hugh Grant) and attractive American      (Andie MacDowell), with a hilarious bit-part by Rowan Atkinson (aka Mr.      Bean). Writer-director Scott Hicks' Australian/UK film Shine (1996) told the story of recovering gifted pianist David Helfgott (Best Actor-winning      Geoffrey Rush) with a history of mental problems. Due to the film's popularity,      the real-life Helfgott went on a musical concert tour, but received mostly      negative reviews. [PAR] The decade's most successful British film was first-time        director Peter Cattaneo's Best Picture-nominated The Full Monty (1997) about a group of displaced, unemployed Sheffield steel-mill workers who        become 'Chippendale-style' male strippers. It brought new popularity to        two hits: Hot Chocolate's \"You Sexy Thing,\" and Donna Summers' \"Hot Stuff.\" The edgy and visually-fresh film about drug addiction, Trainspotting (1995) was based upon Irving Welsh's famous novel        set in Edinburgh, with original Scottish characters (and unknown actors)        including Renton, Spud, Sick Boy and Begbie, and featuring a pulsing soundtrack        with Iggy Pop singing \"Lust for Life\". Although not a British        film, Rob Roy (1995) starred Liam Neeson as 18th century Scottish        legend Robert Roy MacGregor based upon Sir Walter Scott's legendary novel. [PAR] Distinctive Independent Film-Makers: [PAR] In the 90s' era of blockbusters, independent films made            significant headway. The major studios set up specialty art-house production            and distribution divisions, such as Sony Pictures Classics and Fox World Cinema. There were any number of shoestring-budget, non-mainstream            films that appealed to disenchanted Generation-Xers, from directors such            as Richard Linklater, Kevin Smith, Edward Burns, Todd Solondz, Gus Van            Sant and Jim Jarmusch. [PAR] Richard Linklater [PAR] Writer/director                Richard Linklater's first feature Slacker (1991) was a free-form,                low-budget film that defined a generation of dead-beat, drop-out, misfit                individuals living on the edge of the college town of Austin, Texas during                a 24-hour period. [Many of Linklater's films would be contained within                a 24-hour time frame.] The word 'slacker' was immediately seized upon                as a word to define a group within the twenty-something subculture. His                next film, a rambling ensemble drama Dazed and Confused (1993),                dubbed 'the American Graffiti (1973) of                the 90s', followed graduating Texas high-school students on their last                academic day in the Bicentennial year of 1976. The quotable, archetypal                film introduced many exceptional acting newcomers to audiences, including                Milla Jovovich, Ben Affleck, Parker Posey, Renee Zellweger, Matthew McConaughey, Cole Hauser, Adam Goldberg, and Joey Lauren Adams. [PAR] Linklater's more accessible and sweet film Before                  Sunrise (1995) followed the overnight budding romance between a traveling                  young American (Ethan Hawke) and a French student (Julie Delpy) in Vienna,                  and the dialogue-heavy SuBurbia (1997), an adaptation of writer/actor                  Eric Bogosian's play, examined a group of punk twenty-somethings outside                  a suburban Austin convenience store. In the new decade, Linklater's innovative                  6th film, Waking Life (2001) combined digital video and animation                  to produce a highly philosophical avant-garde film.

It is a subsidiary of U.S. media conglomerate Viacom. Paramount is a member of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).  [PAR] In 2014, Paramount Pictures became the first major Hollywood studio to distribute all of its films in digital-form only.  [PAR] Paramount is the fifth oldest surviving film studio in the world,  and America's oldest running studio, founded in 1912.  [PAR] History  [PAR] 1911\u20131920: Early history  [PAR] Paramount is the fifth oldest surviving film studio in the world after the French studios Gaumont Film Company (1895) and Path\u00e9 (1896), followed by the Nordisk Film company (1906), and Universal Studios (1912).  It is the last major film studio still headquartered in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles. [PAR] Paramount Pictures dates its existence from the 1912 founding date of the Famous Players Film Company. Hungarian-born founder, Adolph Zukor, who had been an early investor in nickelodeons, saw that movies appealed mainly to working-class immigrants.  With partners Daniel Frohman and Charles Frohman he planned to offer feature-length films that would appeal to the middle class by featuring the leading theatrical players of the time (leading to the slogan \"Famous Players in Famous Plays\"). By mid-1913, Famous Players had completed five films, and Zukor was on his way to success. Its first film was Les Amours de la reine \u00c9lisabeth, which starred Sarah Bernhardt. [PAR] That same year, another aspiring producer, Jesse L. Lasky, opened his Lasky Feature Play Company with money borrowed from his brother-in-law, Samuel Goldfish, later known as Samuel Goldwyn. The Lasky company hired as their first employee a stage director with virtually no film experience, Cecil B. DeMille, who would find a suitable location site in Hollywood, near Los Angeles, for his first feature film, The Squaw Man. [PAR] Starting in 1914, both Lasky and Famous Players released their films through a start-up company, Paramount Pictures Corporation, organized early that year by a Utah theatre owner, W. W. Hodkinson, who had bought and merged several smaller firms. Hodkinson and actor, director, producer Hobart Bosworth had started production of a series of Jack London movies. Paramount was the first successful nationwide distributor; until this time, films were sold on a statewide or regional basis which had proved costly to film producers. Also, Famous Players and Lasky were privately owned while Paramount was a corporation. [PAR] In 1916, Zukor maneuvered a three-way merger of his Famous Players, the Lasky Company, and Paramount. Zukor and Lasky bought Hodkinson out of Paramount, and merged the three companies into one. The new company Lasky and Zukor founded, Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, grew quickly, with Lasky and his partners Goldwyn and DeMille running the production side, Hiram Abrams in charge of distribution, and Zukor making great plans. With only the exhibitor-owned First National as a rival, Famous Players-Lasky and its \"Paramount Pictures\" soon dominated the business. [PAR] 1921\u20131930: Rise  [PAR] Because Zukor believed in stars, he signed and developed many of the leading early stars, including Mary Pickford, Marguerite Clark, Pauline Frederick, Douglas Fairbanks, Gloria Swanson, Rudolph Valentino, and Wallace Reid. With so many important players, Paramount was able to introduce \"block booking\", which meant that an exhibitor who wanted a particular star's films had to buy a year's worth of other Paramount productions. It was this system that gave Paramount a leading position in the 1920s and 1930s, but which led the government to pursue it on antitrust grounds for more than twenty years. [PAR] The driving force behind Paramount's rise was Zukor. Through the teens and twenties, he built the Publix Theatres Corporation, a chain of nearly 2,000 screens, ran two production studios (in Astoria, New York, now the Kaufman\n\n\n### Answer:\nfamous players film company </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] Location: Hainaut, Belgium [PAR] Status: Sentenced to life in prison on June 22, 2004 [PAR] Marc Dutroux (born 6 November 1956 in Brussels) is a Belgian serial killer and child molester, convicted of having kidnapped, tortured and sexually abused six girls during 1995 and 1996, ranging in age from 8 to 19, four of whom he murdered. He was also convicted of having killed a suspected former accomplice, Bernard Weinstein, later proved insane. [PAR] He was arrested in 1996 and has been in prison since then. His widely publicised trial took place in 2004. A number of shortcomings in the Dutroux investigation caused widespread discontent in Belgium with the country's criminal justice system, and the ensuing scandal was one of the reasons for the reorganisation of Belgium's law enforcement agencies. [PAR] Before the kidnappings [PAR] Dutroux was the eldest of five children; his parents, both teachers, emigrated to the Belgian Congo and returned to Belgium in 1960. They separated in 1971 and Dutroux stayed with his mother but left at age 16, working briefly as a prostitute serving men. He married his first wife at the age of 19; they had two children. He divorced her in 1983. [PAR] At this point, he already had an affair with Michelle Martin. The two would eventually have three children together; they married in 1989 while both were in prison. They divorced in 2003, again while in prison. [PAR] An unemployed electrician, Dutroux had a long criminal history involving car theft, muggings and drug dealing; his is the classic life story of a sociopath. [PAR] In February 1986, Dutroux and Martin were arrested for abducting and raping five young girls. In April 1989 he was sentenced to thirteen and a half years in prison; Martin received a sentence of five years. Showing good behaviour in prison, he was released on parole in April 1992, after having served slightly more than three years. Upon releasing Dutroux, the parole board received a warning letter written by his own mother to the prison director. [PAR] After his release, he was able to convince a psychiatrist that he was disabled, resulting in a government pension. He also received sleeping pills and sedatives from the doctor, which he would later use to quiet the abducted girls. [PAR] He came to own seven houses, most of them vacant, and he used three of them to torture the girls he kidnapped. In his house in Marcinelle near Charleroi (Hainaut), where he lived most of the time, he started to construct a concealed dungeon in the basement. Hidden behind a massive concrete door disguised as a shelf, the cell was 2.15 metres (7 feet) long, less than a meter (3 feet) wide and 1.64 metres (5.38 feet) high.

Some people define spam even more generally as any unsolicited email . However, if a long-lost brother finds your email address and sends you a message, this could hardly be called spam, even though it is unsolicited. Real spam is generally email advertising for some product sent to a mailing list or newsgroup . [PAR] Why is it Called Spam? [PAR] There is some debate about the source of the term, but the generally accepted version is that it comes from the Monty Python song, \"Spam spam spam spam, spam spam spam spam, lovely spam, wonderful spam\". Like the song, spam is an endless repetition of worthless text. Another school of thought maintains that it comes from the computer group lab at the University of Southern California who gave it the name because it has many of the same characteristics as the lunch meat Spam: [PAR] Nobody wants it or ever asks for it. [PAR] No one ever eats it; it is the first item to be pushed to the side when eating the entree. [PAR] Sometimes it is actually tasty, like 1% of junk mail that is really useful to some people. [PAR] The term spam can also be used to describe any \"unwanted\" email from a company or website -- typically at some point a user would have agreed to receive the email via subscription list opt-in -- a newer term called graymail is used to describe this particular type of spam. [PAR] Why Spam is a Problem [PAR] In addition to wasting people's time with unwanted email, spam also eats up a lot of network bandwidth . Consequently, there are many organizations, as well as individuals, who have taken it upon themselves to fight spam with a variety of techniques. But because the Internet is public, there is really little that can be done to prevent spam, just as it is impossible to prevent junk mail. However, some online services have instituted policies to prevent spammers from spamming their subscribers.

[PAR] As baseball embraces the numbers behind the game, 2016 appears to be another year in which the Orioles try to find success in the face of data that say it won't come. [PAR] The sounds of the Orioles' first glove pops and batting practice swings of spring training are often accompanied by the winds of denial, with players and fans alike rejecting projection systems and forecasts that don't match their own assessments. [PAR] Websites that host such projections, and thus hear the brunt of the backlash, say there's plenty of underlying data that support their low expectations for the Orioles, and having been wrong in the past doesn't mean that they'll be wrong again. [PAR] \"The thing that we can kind of take comfort in is we know we're not biasing the projections in any way,\" said Dave Cameron, managing editor of FanGraphs, which has been down on the Orioles in recent years. \"We're not anti-Orioles.

Their sites have created and emphasized stats that even casual fans now use, and both use the extensive data history of the game to make annual projections. [PAR] Both sites take a player's history and the underlying statistics that they control, distribute those \"events\" throughout the course of the season based on playing time and project the number of games a team with that type of history would win in a given season. [PAR] \"We're essentially just forecasting the number and type of events,\" Cameron said. \"We think this team is going to hit X number of home runs, Y number of doubles. We're just kind of aggregating individual player projections and summing them up and trying, based on kind of proven mathematical models, if you have this many home runs and this many walks and give up this many home runs, it will generally translate into this many runs and runs allowed. Then you can turn that into an expected win total.\" [PAR] For the fifth straight season, comprising almost all of the Orioles' recent renaissance, they're projected to finish below .500. As of March 25, Baseball Prospectus' PECOTA (Player Empirical Comparison and Optimization Test Algorithm) system projected the Orioles to go an American League -worst 74-88, and FanGraphs had them at 79-83. But because of some recent seasons in which similar uninspiring projections were blown away, fans are reluctant to take the predictions seriously. [PAR] The Orioles themselves feel this way. Shortstop J.J. Hardy said the Orioles \"know that [analysts'] opinion doesn't matter.\" Manager Buck Showalter said he doesn't read the predictions to begin with. [PAR] And the two sites hear frequently from Orioles fans who point out they don't believe what they're reading because of past success despite low expectations.

In 2012, when the Orioles broke a long playoff drought by finishing 93-69, PECOTA projected them to win 71 games.

[PAR] Jonathan Demme got his start directing Caged Heat (1974), everyone's favorite women-in-prison film. Yes, that's a real genre, women-in-prison, and Caged Heat is the women-in-prisoniest of them all. The movie has \"boobs and blood aplenty,\" yet also features strong female leads. [PAR] Hmm. Blood + boobs + strong female lead = the perfect combination to direct The Silence of the Lambs, a film about a man who kidnaps and skins women and the female FBI agent pursuing him. The Silence of the Lambs made Demme a household name and earned him an Academy Award for Best Director. But Demme didn't forget his roots. Roger Corman, who gave Demme his first directed role on Caged Heat, cameos as the FBI director in Lambs. ( Source ) [PAR] Demme had previously directed Married to the Mob (1988) starring Michelle Pfeiffer, and wanted Pfeiffer to star as Starling in Silence, but she didn't want to be in a film so violent ( source ). So the studio selected Foster, who soon impressed Demme with her presence and her accent. [PAR] Demme, Hopkins, Foster, and screenwriter Ted Tally made the perfect team. You'd think they'd all be back for the sequel, Hannibal, almost a decade later. But Demme read the novel and was \"horrified,\" \u00a0not in a good way.

It is the sequel to the 1986 film Manhunter.  The film is based on Thomas Harris' 1988 novel of the same name, his second to feature Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. In the film, Clarice Starling, a young U.S. FBI trainee, seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Lecter to apprehend another serial killer, known only as \"Buffalo Bill\". [PAR] The Silence of the Lambs was released on February 14, 1991, and grossed $272.7 million worldwide against its $19 million budget. It was only the third film, the other two being It Happened One Night and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay. It is also the first (and so far only) Best Picture winner widely considered to be a horror film, and only the third such film to be nominated in the category, after The Exorcist in 1973 and Jaws in 1975.  The film is considered \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant by the U.S. Library of Congress and was selected to be preserved in the National Film Registry in 2011.

In 1990, when he was 19 years and 28 days old, Sampras became the youngest US Open men\u2019s singles champion in history, defeating his career-rival Andre Agassi, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2. Twelve years later, Sampras ended his record-breaking career at the US Open, winning his fifth singles title at his home major and fourth overall against Agassi, 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4. In between those 12 years, Sampras carved out a place in history with a then-record 14 major singles titles (since tied by Rafael Nadal and passed by Roger Federer with 17), and unequivocally placed his name among the best ever to wield a racquet. [PAR] Sampras wasn\u2019t an overnight success, it took two arduous years taking his lumps on the professional tour to round into a big-serving, big match player, but when he retired a 14-time major champion (seven Wimbledon titles, five US Open championships, two Australian Open victories), he was regarded worldwide as the consummate champion who won 14 of 18 finals, a 78 percent winning mark, best in history. His seven Wimbledon and five US Open titles are tied for best all-time. Sampras compiled a 762-222 career singles record, top-10 all-time, and captured 64 tour singles titles in 265 overall tournaments (was a finalist in 24 tournaments), fifth best all-time. In a five-year span of tour domination from 1993 through 1998, Sampras held a stranglehold on the ATP year-end rankings, finishing the year as the world\u2019s No. 1 player six consecutive years, a record that he still holds. Jimmy Connors had held that distinction for five years (1974-78). [PAR] In comparison to his flamboyant and flashy nemesis Agassi, who Sampras faced 34 times in his career (winning 20 matches and defeating his rival in four of five major finals), Sampras was all-business on court. \u201cI let my racquet do the talking,\u201d he consistently told the media when asked why he wasn\u2019t more colorful on court. \u201cThat\u2019s what I am all about, really. I just go out and win tennis matches. I never wanted to be the great guy or the colorful guy or the interesting guy. I wanted to be the guy who won matches.\u201d [PAR] Until Sampras won his 13th\u00a0major title, Aussie Roy Emerson held \u2013 since 1967 \u2013 the record for men\u2019s single major wins with 12. When Sampras defeated Agassi to win the 2002 US Open, Sampras became the fifth oldest champion in history at 31 years, 27 days, and the oldest since his idol Rod Laver (31 years, 1 month) in 1969. [PAR] The Potomac, Maryland native groomed his game in Rancho Palos Verdes, California at the Jack Kramer Tennis Club. In a five-year span starting in 1985 he went from 5-foot-5 to 6-foot tall and refined his game immensely, abandoning his two-handed backhand for a one-hander and ditching his wooden racquet for the new graphite technology. He turned professional at age 16 in 1988, launching his career as the No. 893 ranked player in the world.

They are Laver, Rosewall and Emerson. [PAR] Pete Sampras isn't playing for today; he's competing for history. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Pete Sampras needs to win on the clay of the French Open to be considered the best ever. [PAR] When he won his sixth Wimbledon championship in 1999, it gave him 12 Grand Slam singles titles, tying Roy Emerson ior most majors all time. [PAR] Though he had earned more than $35 million in ATP Tour earnings going into 1999, it is Grand Slams that consume him. The easy-going, hard-hitting Sampras would trade a dozen of his 55 Tour victories (through 1998) for one French Open or another Australian. Let others play for money; he's playing for majors. [PAR] \"I measure my year on how I do at the majors and the more that I have won over the years, the more I want to win,\" Sampras said. \"I don't look at myself as a historical icon, but the reality of it is, yeah, I am playing for history now.\" [PAR] Sampras, 27, is not the indifferent jock he pretends to be. While he gives the impression that he doesn't play with a passion, he deeply wants to be remembered as the best ever. \"I don't think it's arrogant,\" Sampras said. \"I'm not ashamed that I feel that I can actually do it.\" [PAR] Yet, he is uncomfortable in the spotlight. He is a throwback to the days when gentleman played the sport of tennis. \"I could be a jerk and get a lot more publicity, but that's not who I am,\" said Sampras, who believes in the past, but came of age in the 1990s. [PAR] Although Sampras is tied with Emerson for the Slams record, he was taught to emulate Rod Laver, the winner of two Grand Slams, 11 majors, and generally regarded as the game's greatest. [PAR] \"There wasn't an American that I really idolized,\" Sampras said. \"Sure, I respected (John) McEnroe's talent and (Jimmy) Connors' intensity, but the Aussies, those guys were great guys.\" And the players he admired most were the gentlemanly Laver and Ken Rosewall. [PAR] Since 1993, when he first claimed the No. 1 ranking, the 6-foot-1 Sampras has stood head and shoulders above his playing opponents. While he has a ferocious forehand and sensational serve, his greatest gift may be his will to win. He's not afraid to leave his guts on the courts -- literally. [PAR] He was born Aug. 12, 1971 in Washington, D.C., and grew up in Palos Verdes, Cal. His father, Soterios, called Sam, was an aerospace engineer for the Department of Defense and his mother, Georgia, was a homemaker. [PAR] He began playing tennis at seven and when he was nine, his father asked Pete Fischer, a physician and amateur player, to hit with his son. Fischer was so impressed with the youngster's ability, he became his coach. [PAR] When Sampras was 11, he had the opportunity to trade groundstrokes with Laver, his idol. \"Pete was so nervous he couldn't get the ball over the net,\" Fischer said.

Cleveland and Columbus also competed for the chance to host the 2016 Democratic convention before Philadelphia landed it.

Columbus: The Arch City is the state capital and also Ohio's most heavily populated city. It is the third largest Midwestern city in the United States with a population of 822,553 according to 2013 estimates. Columbus is home to the Ohio State University, which is the state's flagship institution of higher education. It is also a noted hub for independent art. [PAR] 2. Cleveland: On the shores of Lake Erie, Cleveland is a destination for legions of music lovers. It houses the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, a museum that showcases the history of that music genre along with notable past and present rock and roll musicians. Cleveland is also the birthplace of Standard Oil. John D. Rockefeller founded his company there in 1870. It has remained an important manufacturing center since that time. [PAR] 3. Cincinnati: The third largest city in Ohio was the first American city founded after the Revolutionary War, in 1788. Less than a century later, it earned the distinction of being the first place to establish a pro baseball team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, in 1869.

Juilliard was founded in 1905 as the Institute of Musical Art by Dr. Frank Damrosch, the godson of Franz Liszt and the head of music education for New York City\u2019s public schools. Damrosch was convinced that American musicians should not have to go abroad for advanced study, and created the Institute as an American music academy that would provide an educational experience comparable to that of the established European conservatories. With the initial enrollment figures nearly five times what was expected, the Institute quickly outgrew its original home at Fifth Avenue and 12th Street (seen in photo above) and moved to new quarters near Columbia University in 1910.\u00a0\u00a0 [PAR] Nine years later, a wealthy textile merchant named Augustus Juilliard died and left in his will the largest single bequest for the advancement of music at that time. The trustees of the bequest founded the Juilliard Graduate School in 1924 to help worthy music students complete their education. In 1926, the Graduate School and the Institute of Musical Art merged to become the Juilliard School of Music under one president, the distinguished Columbia University professor John Erskine. Erskine was succeeded in 1937 by renowned concert pianist and composer Ernest Hutcheson, who served in the position until 1945.

On 29 May 1953, Hillary and Nepalese Sherpa mountaineer Tenzing Norgay became the first climbers to reach the summit of Mount Everest. They were part of the ninth British expedition to Everest, led by John Hunt. Hillary was named by Time as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. [PAR] Hillary became interested in mountaineering while in secondary school, making his first major climb in 1939, reaching the summit of Mount Ollivier. He served in the Royal New Zealand Air Force as a navigator during World War II. Prior to the 1953 Everest expedition, Hillary had been part of the British reconnaissance expedition to the mountain in 1951, as well as an unsuccessful attempt to climb Cho Oyu in 1952. As part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition he reached the South Pole overland in 1958. He subsequently reached the North Pole, making him the first person to reach both poles and summit Everest. [PAR] Following his ascent of Everest, Hillary devoted most of his life to helping the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, which he founded. Through his efforts, many schools and hospitals were built in Nepal. [PAR] Early life [PAR] Hillary was born to Percival Augustus and Gertrude (n\u00e9e Clark) Hillary in Auckland, New Zealand, on 20 July 1919.

[PAR] Hillary was educated at Tuakau Primary School and then Auckland Grammar School. He finished primary school two years early and at high school achieved average marks.  He was initially smaller than his peers there and very shy so he took refuge in his books and daydreams of a life filled with adventure. His daily train journey to and from high school was over two hours each way, during which he regularly used the time to read. He gained confidence after he learned to box. At 16 his interest in climbing was sparked during a school trip to Mount Ruapehu. Though gangly at 6\u00a0ft 5 in (195\u00a0cm) and uncoordinated, he found that he was physically strong and had greater endurance than many of his tramping companions.[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article3170995.ece Hillary mourned, both in Nepal and New Zealand] Timesonline.co.uk dated 11 January 2008.

The very fact that The Butler had been booked in a historic venue designed for Cinerama-like spectacles marked Daniels\u2019 film as an event \u2014 a pretty remarkable thing for a history film headlined by not-conventionally-bankable black actors from a director whose last movie made less than a million dollars and was most remarked on for its scene of Nicole Kidman peeing on Zach Efron (PS: you should really see The Paperboy). The Butler is my favorite Lee Daniels film for John Cusack-as-Richard Nixon alone, but I also found Oprah Winfrey\u2019s performance as the butler\u2019s wife \u2014 a black American housewife whose not inconsiderable power is limited to the domestic sphere and who experiences the social evolutions of the twentieth century first as a passive spectator on television, and then through the ways in which they cause the men in her life to treat her \u2014 to be pretty mesmerizing. It\u2019s not just the lack of vanity, the lack of self-consciousness. There\u2019s a sense of freedom to the performance that could only come from an actor shrugging off all inhibitions and putting their total trust in their director. [PAR] Other actors have spoken of this phenomenon when working with Daniels, but it\u2019s not something I expected from Oprah, whose dawning as a superstar happened just before the dawning of me as a sentient media watcher, and who I had never envisioned as anything but completely calculating about herself as a commodity, even if/when her brand epitomized vulnerability. To quote Roger Ebert \u2014 Oprah\u2019s closest counterpart in Chicago media dominance, whom she briefly dated \u2014 \u201cHer whole persona is about controlling her own destiny \u2013 owning herself.\u201d If her performance in The Butler is special because of her surrender of ownership \u2014 her total submission to Daniels and his sometimes wacky but almost always emotionally true methods of forcing repressed desire out into the open \u2014 then what made her do it, and why is this happening now? [PAR] Ebert made his comment about Oprah\u2019s persona in the context of interviewing her about Beloved, Oprah\u2019s last feature film before The Butler, and perhaps the ultimate example of her self-determination going awry. The film adaptation of Toni Morrison\u2019s novel, directed by Jonathan Demme, came out fifteen years ago this month, after a decade-long struggle to the screen and months of hype, controversy, and hindsight-is-20-20 declarations that the Best Actress Oscar was Winfrey\u2019s to lose. Widely considered to be Winfrey\u2019s all-in bid to prove herself as a serious actress/vault herself onto equal or even higher footing with the celebrities she interviewed (although Oprah would describe her efforts in much loftier terms), Beloved underwhelmed at the box office, and disappeared from the conversation long before Saving Private Ryan and Shakespeare in Love duked it out on Oscar night. 1 Beloved\u2018s failure seems all the more stark when contrasted against the enormous success of The Butler. The only film this year to top the box office three weeks in a row prior to Gravity, The Butler has so far earned over $113 million, and if early buzz (and the presumed power of Harvey Weinstein) holds, it seems poised to play a role in the awards season zeitgeist \u2014 that is, if there\u2019s room for it alongside 12 Years a Slave, which has already been anointed by some as the film to beat, and which shares with The Butler based-on-a-true story legitimacy. Given the history of the Oscars \u2014 one which Oprah has uniquely played a role in as both a nominee, and a journalist/merchant of hype \u2014 for two films dealing with black American history to be major players in the same Best Picture race would be kind of a big deal.

Partially inspired by 1958's It! The Terror      from Beyond Space, this instant classic set a tone of its own, offering      richly detailed sets, ominous atmosphere, relentless suspense, and a      flawless ensemble cast as the crew of the space freighter Nostromo fall prey      to a vicious creature (designed by Swiss artist H.R. Giger) that had      gestated inside one of the ill-fated crew members. \u2014 Amazon.com [PAR] Science          fiction is a handy genre: it is possible for people who doesn't really          know much about it to transpose another genre (western, horror, detective)          unto it, look cool in the process and make a bundle at the box office. [PAR] It is seldom that a \"pure\" science fiction movie gets made without          all kinds of genres transposed unto it - take Star Wars for example, which is a pastiche of every      movie genre known to mankind. It is not one movie, but      all movies, thus falling perfectly under egghead Umberto Eco's definition of      a cult movie. [PAR] \"Despite the plot's limitations, director Ridley Scott pulls it all off          with amazing visual aplomb . . .\" [PAR] Alien is a horror flick set in outer space. The old haunted house is the giant          space ship Nostromo. The monster is a vicious (a truly original) alien          designed by Swiss artist HR Giger. [PAR] The teenagers in the old house are          the ship's crew: Sigourney Weaver, John Hurt, et al. Predictably the alien          kills them all off until only a lone female crew member remains. [PAR] Much has          been made of the Alien movies being feminist. This is true to an          extent, in that its female protagonist Ripley (Weaver) doesn't wait and          hang around to be rescued by a male. Instead she does the Rambo thing herself - particularly in the first sequel ( Aliens )          - and blow away those alien mothers herself! But          the plot device in the first Alien movie is one that has been done          the year before by Jamie Lee Curtis in Carpenter's Halloween horror          movie and every subsequent slasher movie from Friday the 13th to Nightmare on Elm Street. [PAR] However, despite          the plot's limitations, director Ridley Scott pulls it all off with amazing          visual aplomb - having made his debut in the advertising business, Scott          has got that 1980s \"look\" to all his movies. [PAR] This film is no          exception: first there is the stunning designs by Swiss artist HR Giger.          His stuff is like the Surrealists on a really very bad day. [PAR] Giger and          Scott creates a sense of unease by placing human protagonists against          an alien and surreal backdrop - one of the basic ingredients of sci-fi. [PAR] Both the Nostromo and the alien world where the alien gets picked up are          strange and unforgettably original. Claustrophobic, the Nostromo is grimy          and dark - continuing the tradition set by Star          Wars and 2001 of giving the viewing public          space ships that look like they might actually work! [PAR] Add to this          stunning special effects and an alien brought to life by special effects          wiz Carlos Rambaldi (who later designed E.T. !),          brooding music by Jerry Goldsmith (Oscar winner for The Omen) and          it is not difficult to see why the movie has achieved both the cult status          and box office success it did . . . a hit with both horror and sci-fi          fans, it spawned three sequels: Aliens (in 1986), Alien          3 (1992) and Alien Resurrection (1997).

It was opened in the 1869 to allow water transportation between Europe and Asia to avoid ships navigation around Africa. The canal original size was 164 km long and 8metre deep. However enlargements have been undertaken and it now has a length of 193.30 km and its 24 metres deep. It also has a northern access channel of 22 km and 9 km southern access. The canal has a northern terminus known as Port Said and a southern terminus called Port Tewfik. [PAR] Suez Canal is owned and maintained by the Suez Canal Authority of the Arab Republic of Egypt. A treaty signed under the International Treaty Act shows that the canal can be used in times of war or peace by every vessel of commerce or of war and no flag is required for distinction. The canal allows passage of ships up to 20 metres and with weight of 240,000 tons. The height allowed above water is a maximum of 68 metres. Big ships offload their cargo to canal- owned boats to reduce their weight and reload later at the end of the canal. [PAR] Suez Canal attracts a lot of visitors who come to see the amazing wonders of this man made sea. It serves as the first salt water passage between the Mediterranean and Red Seas. The canal has attracted attention from film makers. A film known as Suez was made in 1938 and it's based on the canal's history. Also in the novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne, a character known as Nautilus travels through an underwater passage beneath the Suez Canal. All these highlight the canal as a very import part in opening up Africa to other parts of the world. [PAR] Subscribe, Like and coment the video for more content.

It is believed that the first canal in the area was constructed between the Nile River delta and the Red Sea in the 13th Century B.C.E. During the 1,000 years following its construction, the original canal was neglected and its use finally stopped in the 8th Century. [PAR] The first modern attempts to build a canal came in the late 1700s when Napoleon Bonaparte conducted an expedition to Egypt. He believed that building a French controlled canal on the Isthmus of Suez would cause trade problems for the British as they would either have to pay dues to France or continue sending goods over land or around the southern part of Africa. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Test Your General Science Knowledge [PAR] Studies for Napoleon's canal plan began in 1799 but a miscalculation in measurement showed the sea levels between the Mediterranean and the Red Seas as being too different for a canal to be feasible and construction immediately stopped. [PAR] The next attempt to build a canal in the area occurred in the mid-1800s when a French diplomat and engineer, Ferdinand de Lesseps, convinced the Egyptian viceroy Said Pasha to support the building of a canal. In 1858, the Universal Suez Ship Canal Company was formed and given the right to begin construction of the canal and operate it for 99 years, after which\n\n\n### Answer:\nred sea </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

The first, \u201cThe Babe Ruth Story,\u201d done in 1948, starred William Bendix as the Bambino. Generally regarded as a terrible film with Bendix horribly miscast in the lead role, the film sugar coated Ruth\u2019s life beyond recognition. Hollywood\u2019s second effort at telling the Babe\u2019s life was filmed in 1992. Called, \u201cThe Babe,\u201d it starred John Goodman as the Sultan of the Swat and received more favorable reviews, with Leonard Maltin calling it \u201cagreeably sentimental.\u201d Maltin also notes, however, that \u201cfacts are tampered with and often ignored\u201d in both films. That is certainly true in how they overlook reality in depicting Ruth\u2019s last game as a Major Leaguer. [PAR] A Last Hurrah [PAR] In 1935, Babe Ruth was forty years old, in poor physical shape, and playing out the string with the Boston Braves. On May 25, 1935, with the team on a road trip and playing at Forbes File in Pittsburgh, Ruth hammered three home runs and a single, driving in six runs. The last, off pitcher Guy Bush, was the 714th of Ruth\u2019s career and the first ball ever to be hit completely over Forbes Field\u2019s right-field roof (added to the ballpark in 1925). Thanks to Hollywood, many people believe that was Ruth\u2019s final Major League game\u2014circling the bases in triumph one last time before going into the dugout, entering the clubhouse, and calling it a career. The scene, undoubtedly, provides a storybook conclusion to a fabled tale. Wouldst that it was true; but regrettably, it is not. Maybe Ruth should have called it a career at that point, but perhaps sensing that the old magic was back, he hung around for one more game. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Final Stop [PAR] After leaving Pittsburgh, the Braves next stop on their road trip was Philadelphia. There, they would play the Philadelphia Phillies at Baker Bowl. Like Babe Ruth, Baker Bowl\u2019s days of glory had receded to the past. The ballpark, widely ridiculed for its deteriorating condition, was near the end of its life as the home of a Major League baseball team. The Phillies would finally abandon it mid-way through the 1938 season, moving down Lehigh Avenue to become tenants of the Philadelphia Athletics at Shibe Park. But, there was one more moment of drama to be played out at the old place, mixing both acclamation and pathos. Babe Ruth would provide it on May 30, 1935. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] The Braves were scheduled to play the Phillies in a Memorial Day doubleheader. Ruth was inserted in the line-up, batting third and playing leftfield. Coming up to bat in the first inning, Ruth faced Phillies\u2019 pitcher Jim Bivin. 1935 was Bivin\u2019s only year in the Major Leagues, and he played the entire season with the Phillies. He compiled an unenviable 2-9 record for a woeful team that would finish the season in seventh place with a 56-93 record. Bivin, nevertheless, would have the singular distinction of being the last pitcher ever to face Babe Ruth in a Major League game. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] At the plate, Ruth grounded out softly to Phillies first baseman Dolph Camilli as the Braves went down without scoring any runs in the inning. Ruth took his customary place in the outfield for the bottom half of the inning. Phillies\u2019 second baseman Lou Chiozza hit a soft fly to leftfield. Ruth came in trying to make the catch, but the ball dropped in front of him and rolled past to the wall. A run scored, but Chiozza, trying for an inside-the-park home run, was thrown out at the plate when Braves shortstop Bill Urbanski retrieved the ball and got it back to Braves catcher Al Spohrer in time for the tag out. The Phillies wound up scoring three runs in the inning and would go on to win the game 11-6.

It reached No. 1 in Australia, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, South Africa, and the United States, and was a major hit in many other countries as well. The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart on July 14, 1962, and remained there for four weeks.   The single was also the first number-one hit for Epic Records. Billboard ranked the record as the No. 4 song of 1962.  [PAR] Vinton found the song in a reject pile at Epic Records. He first recorded it as an R&B number, but was allowed to re-record it in a slower more dramatic arrangement, with strings and a vocal choir added. [PAR] Ronnie Carroll version [PAR] In the UK, a cover version by Ronnie Carroll reached No. 3 on the Record Retailer chart on August 8, 1962, the same week that the Bobby Vinton record peaked at No. 15.   It peaked at No. 7 in the very first Irish Singles Chart published in October 1962. [PAR] Other versions [PAR] The song was recorded by Jim Reeves in 1963 and released on the album Gentleman Jim, one of the last albums released while he was still alive. While it did not chart in the US, it became a minor hit in Norway and Germany. [PAR] The song was covered by Singaporean female artist Zhuang Xue Fang (\u838a\u96ea\u82b3), in edited Standard Chinese lyrics written by Suyin (\u8212\u96f2/\u96e8\u725b) under title name of \u73ab\u7470\u82b1\u9999, with Ruby Records in 1967.

The song spent seven weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 62,  while reaching No. 15 on Billboards Easy Listening chart.

On learning this, director Steven Spielberg decided to make young Indy a Life Scout in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. [PAR] 3. Harrison's route into acting wasn\u2019t totally planned; he initially only attended a drama class in his senior year at college to overcome his shyness. [PAR] 4. He shares his name with a silent film actor also named Harrison Ford, who died in 1957. To avoid any confusion, Ford called himself \"Harrison J. Ford\" in his first movie credit, the 1967 film A Time for Killing. The \"J\" doesn\u2019t actually stand for anything, as Harrison has no middle name. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] 5. The Hollywood star has experienced a phenomenally successful career, but this wasn\u2019t always the case. When he first started out, Harrison was unhappy with the film roles he was offered, so became a self-taught professional carpenter to support his young family. [PAR] This is how he met George Lucas , who would go on to cast him as \"Han Solo\" in the Star Wars\u00a0franchise. The director hired Harrison to build cabinets at his home, but after learning the craftsman was actually an actor, he gave him a role in his 1973 film American Graffiti. [PAR] 6.

Gore actually said that he \"took the initiative in creating the Internet\" [source: CNN ]. He promoted the Internet's development both as a senator and as vice president of the United States . So how did the Internet really get started? Believe it or not, it all began with a satellite . [PAR] It was 1957 when the then Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first man-made satellite. Americans were shocked by the news. The Cold War was at its peak, and the United States and the Soviet Union considered each other enemies. If the Soviet Union could launch a satellite into space , it was possible it could launch a missile at North America . [PAR] Up Next [PAR] How the Deep Web Works [PAR] President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in 1958 as a direct response to Sputnik's launch. ARPA's purpose was to give the United States a technological edge over other countries. One important part of ARPA's mission was computer science. [PAR] In the 1950s, computers were enormous devices that filled entire rooms. They had a fraction of the power and processing ability you can find in a modern PC . Many computers could only read magnetic tape or punch cards, and there was no way to network computers together. [PAR] ARPA aimed to change that. It enlisted the help of the company Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) to create a computer network. The network had to connect four computers running on four different operating systems . They called the network ARPANET .\u00ad [PAR] Without ARPANET, the Internet wouldn't look or behave the way it does today -- it might not even exist. Although other groups were working on ways to network computers, ARPANET established the protocols used on the Internet today. Moreover, without ARPANET, it may have taken many more years before anyone tried to find ways to join regional networks together into a larger system. [PAR] In the next section, we'll look at how ARPANET joined with other networks to create the Internet. [PAR] \u00ad [PAR] Taming the Internet [PAR] Several organizations and committees formed to help shape the Internet into what it is today.

The theory goes on to suggest that the Internet network invented in the Pentagon was designed to survive a nuclear attack.

[PAR] Contunico \u00a9 ZDF Enterprises GmbH, Mainz [PAR] The first subway system was proposed for London by Charles Pearson, a city solicitor, as part of a city-improvement plan shortly after the opening of the Thames Tunnel in 1843. After 10 years of discussion, Parliament authorized the construction of 3.75 miles (6 km) of underground railway between Farringdon Street and Bishop\u2019s Road, Paddington. Work on the Metropolitan Railway began in 1860 by cut-and-cover methods \u2014that is, by making trenches along the streets, giving them brick sides, providing girders or a brick arch for the roof, and then restoring the roadway on top. On Jan. 10, 1863, the line was opened using steam locomotives that burned coke and, later, coal; despite sulfurous fumes, the line was a success from its opening, carrying 9,500,000 passengers in the first year of its existence. In 1866 the City of London and Southwark Subway Company (later the City and South London Railway) began work on their \u201ctube\u201d line, using a tunneling shield developed by J.H. Greathead. The tunnels were driven at a depth sufficient to avoid interference with building foundations or public-utility works, and there was no disruption of street traffic. The original plan called for cable operation, but electric traction was substituted before the line was opened. Operation began on this first electric underground railway in 1890 with a uniform fare of twopence for any journey on the 3-mile (5-kilometre) line. In 1900 Charles Tyson Yerkes , an American railway magnate, arrived in London, and he was subsequently responsible for the construction of more tube railways and for the electrification of the cut-and-cover lines. During World Wars I and II the tube stations performed the unplanned function of air-raid shelters. [PAR] Similar Topics [PAR] bus [PAR] Many other cities followed London\u2019s lead. In Budapest , a 2.5-mile (4-kilometre) electric subway was opened in 1896, using single cars with trolley poles; it was the first subway on the European continent. Considerable savings were achieved in its construction over earlier cut-and-cover methods by using a flat roof with steel beams instead of a brick arch, and therefore, a shallower trench. [PAR] In Paris , the M\u00e9tro (Chemin de Fer M\u00e9tropolitain de Paris) was started in 1898, and the first 6.25 miles (10 km) were opened in 1900. The rapid progress was attributed to the wide streets overhead and the modification of the cut-and-cover method devised by the French engineer Fulgence Bienvenue. Vertical shafts were sunk at intervals along the route; and, from there, side trenches were dug and masonry foundations to support wooden shuttering were placed immediately under the road surfaces. Construction of the roof arch then proceeded with relatively little disturbance to street traffic. This method, while it is still used in Paris, has not been widely copied in subway construction elsewhere. [PAR] In the United States the first practical subway line was constructed in Boston between 1895 and 1897. It was 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long and at first used trolley streetcars, or tramcars. Later, Boston acquired conventional subway trains. New York City opened the first section of what was to become the largest system in the world on Oct. 27, 1904. In Philadelphia, a subway system was opened in 1907, and Chicago\u2019s system opened in 1943.

In the meantime Billie Jo Spears and Margie Singleton also recorded versions of the song, but Riley\u2019s recording not only topped the charts, but gave her a TV variety show of her own to star in.

That club belonged to Philadelphia and despite winning National League pennants in 1915 and 1950; the Phillies were still waiting to go the distance after ninety-eight seasons. Their opponents, the Kansas City Royals weren't strangers to second place either. One step away from World Series appearances in '76, '77 and '78, both teams had suffered heartbreaking losses in three consecutive Championship Series. After losing all three American League versions to New York, Kansas City swept the perennial champions in 1980 after a three game playoff series. Throughout the 1970's, both ball clubs had come up short time and time again and it was fitting that they both reached the summit concurrently to face one another in baseball's most coveted contest. [PAR] As Game 1 opened at Veterans Stadium, Royals veteran Amos Otis nailed a two run homer for his first Series at-bat and teammate Willie Aikens followed with a one on blast of his own. Dennis Leonard (a twenty game winner) took the mound in the bottom of the inning tasked with protecting the 4-0 lead, but Philadelphia erupted with a five run blitz that included a three run homer by Bake McBride. Then the National League champions scored two more over the next two innings with Bob Boone delivering his second run-scoring double and Garry Maddox adding a sacrifice fly. Aikens answered back with his second, two run homer of the night in the eighth, but the comeback Phillies were still left clinging to a 7-6 lead. Tug McGraw came in as relief over Bob Walk in the final inning and managed to hold off the Royals for three quick outs and the opening game win. [PAR] Once again, the Vet belonged to \"the vet\" as Otis knocked a two run double off Phillies standout Steve Carlton for the 3-2 lead in the seventh inning of Game 2. John Wathan followed and proceeded to send the Royal workhorse home with a sacrifice fly as Dan Quisenberry was sent in to protect the lead. Working in relief of Larry Gura, Quisenberry sent the first three Philly batters back to the bench, but ran into trouble in the eighth. Surrendering four hits (resulting in four runs) the Kansas City ace watched his team's lead vanish thanks to McBride (who singled home the tying run) and Mike Schmidt (who doubled his team ahead). Ron Reed was sent in from the home team bullpen in the ninth and held onto the advantage for a 6-4 victory. [PAR] Adding to the Royals 0-2 frustrations was the untimely removal of standout George Brett, who had almost caught Ted Williams' record of .400 during the regular season but came up just short (in true Royals fashion) at .390. The All-Star third-baseman was suffering from an acute case of hemorrhoids, and was immediately scheduled to undergo minor surgery. After leaving the hospital on the day of Game 3, a pain-free Brett returned to the diamond and removed all doubts with a first inning homer off the Phillies' Dick Ruthven. Both teams continued to trade runs (including another home run by Otis) and at the end of regulation, the scoreboard read 3-3. Kansas City was determined to prevent another Philadelphia comeback and Aikens came through in the bottom of the tenth with a two out single that scored Willie Wilson for the 4-3 triumph. The multi-talented first baseman had continued to come up clutch with a two run homer in the Royals' first and a bases empty shot in the second. The two drives made Aikens the first man in history to connect for a pair of two-homer games in one Series. [PAR] In Game 4, a rejuvenated Royals team held the Phillies to a 0-0 tie going into the fourth and for the first time in the tournament, prepared to take the lead. After Schmidt broke the tie by depositing a Gura pitch over the wall for a two run advantage, Kansas City answered back\n\n\n### Answer:\nphillies </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills.

His eighteen-year term as General Secretary was second only to that of Joseph Stalin in duration. During Brezhnev's rule, the global influence of the Soviet Union grew dramatically, in part because of the expansion of the Soviet military during this time. His tenure as leader was marked by the beginning of an era of economic and social stagnation in the Soviet Union. [PAR] Brezhnev was born in Kamianske into a Russian worker's family. After graduating from the Dniprodzerzhynsk Metallurgical Technicum, he became a metallurgical engineer in the iron and steel industry, in Ukraine. He joined Komsomol in 1923, and in 1929 became an active member of the CPSU. He was drafted into immediate military service during World War II and left the army in 1946 with the rank of major general. In 1952 Brezhnev became a member of the Central Committee, and during 1964, Brezhnev succeeded Nikita Khrushchev as First Secretary, while Alexei Kosygin succeeded Khrushchev in his post as Soviet premier. [PAR] As a leader, Brezhnev took care to consult his colleagues before acting, but his attempt to govern without meaningful economic reforms led to a national decline by the mid-1970s, a period referred to as the Era of Stagnation. A significant increase in military expenditure, which by the time of Brezhnev's death stood at approximately 12.5% of the country's GNP, and an aging and ineffective leadership set the stage for a dwindling GNP compared to Western nations. While at the helm of the USSR, Brezhnev pushed for d\u00e9tente between the Eastern and Western countries. At the same time he presided over the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia to stop the Prague Spring, and he sent the Soviet military to Afghanistan in an attempt to save the fragile regime, which was fighting a war against the mujahideen. However, in December 1981 he decided not to militarily intervene in Poland, instead allowing the country's government to impose martial law, and effectively marking the end of the Brezhnev Doctrine. [PAR] After years of declining health, Brezhnev died on 10 November 1982 and was quickly succeeded in his post as General Secretary by Yuri Andropov. Brezhnev had fostered a cult of personality, although not nearly to the same degree as Stalin. Mikhail Gorbachev, who would lead the USSR from 1985 to 1991, denounced his legacy and drove the process of liberalisation of the Soviet Union. In spite of this, opinion polls in Russia show Brezhnev to be the most popular Russian leader of the 20th century. [PAR] Early life and career [PAR] Origins and education [PAR] Brezhnev was born on 19 December 1906 in Kamianske in Ukraine), to metalworker Ilya Yakovlevich Brezhnev and his wife, Natalia Denisovna Mazalova. His parents used to live in Brezhnevo (Kursky District, Kursk Oblast, Russia) before moving to Kamenskoe. Brezhnev's ethnicity was specified as Ukrainian in some documents,   including his passport,  and Russian in others.  Like many youths in the years after the Russian Revolution of 1917, he received a technical education, at first in land management where he started as a land surveyor and then in metallurgy.

It  has the declared aim of destroying Israel and replacing it with a 'secular democratic state.' 'Fatah' means victory in  Arabic. The name is also a reverse acronym for Harakat Tahrir el Wataniyeha Filistiniyeh - Palestine Liberation  Movement. It\u00a0 represents the moderate end of the Palestinian political spectrum. Their slogan is \"Revolution  until Victory.\" [PAR] Fatah was founded by Yasser Arafat ,  Khalil Al Wazir (Abu Jihad) Farouq Kadumi, Mahmoud Abbas, Khalid al-Hassan and other Palestinian refugeees in Kuwait. Many, like Arafat,  had a background\u00a0 in Ikhwan (fedayoun) groups (a tag which stuck until \ufffd68) drawn from refugees in Gaza, which  provided military training to Palestinian youth. Ikhwan military bodies eg Revenge Youth and\u00a0 Battalion of Right (led by  Khalil al Wazir); launched small sabotage attacks on Israel from late 1954 and\u00a0 pulled away from disapproving Ikhwan.  They also refused to get involved in Ikhwan-Egypt conflict, which resulted in Wazir's expulsion from Egypt. Wazir later\u00a0 moved to Saudi Arabia, then joined Arafat in Kuwai). Yasser Arafat at this stage was working through Palestinian  Students Union in Cairo; formed alliance with youth leaders (especially Khalaf) and Palestinian activists in Syria  (especially \ufffdAdil \ufffdAbd al-Karim and\u00a0 \ufffdAbdullah al-Dannan).\u00a0 In 1957, after university,\u00a0 activists  including Yasser Arafat and\u00a0 Mahmoud Abbas \u00a0formed a clandestine  organization in Kuwait, taking the name Fatah in 1959 or 1960 or according to other accounts, at the foundation meeting. Fatah was to be modeled on the Algerian FLN as a \"National Liberation Movement\" that would win support of the Palestinian masses for armed liberation of Palestine. This  was opposed to the traditional terror-only strategy that relied on Arab countries to liberate Palestine. Fatah achieved  popularity through the Filastinuna magazine edited by Yasser Arafat.

[PAR] Background [PAR] On Sunday morning, December 7, 1941, the American Army and Navy base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii was attacked by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The attack came as a surprise to the American Army and Navy and lead to great losses of life and equipment. More than 2000 American citizens were killed and more than 1000 were injured. The Americans also lost a large proportion of their battle ships and nearly 200 aircraft that were stationed in the Pacific region. More than 60 Japanese servicemen were killed, injured or captured. The Japanese Navy also lost five midget submarines and 29 aircraft. [PAR] The Japanese military had hoped that the attack on Pearl Harbor would prevent the United States of America from increasing her influence in the Pacific. However, the events in Pearl Harbor actually led to the escalation of World War II. The day after the attack, the United States declared war on Japan and so entered World War II. President Franklin Roosevelt in a speech to Congress stated that the bombing of Pearl Harbor was \u201ca date which will live in infamy\u201d. Shortly afterwards, Germany also declared war on the United States. In the months that followed the attack, the slogan \u201cRemember Pearl Harbor\u201d swept the United States and radio stations repeatedly played a song of the same name. [PAR] In 1991, which marked the 50th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States Congress established the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Medal. This is also known as the Pearl Harbor Survivor's Medal and can be awarded to any veteran of the United States military who were present in or around Pearl Harbor during the attack by the Japanese military. The medal can be awarded to civilians, who were killed or injured in the attack. [PAR] Symbols [PAR] Memorials have been built to remember or to symbolize the day. For example, the USS Arizona Memorial in Pearl Harbor is a marble memorial built over the sunken USS Arizona, which was dedicated in 1962. The memorial remembers all military personnel who were killed in the Pearl Harbor attack. The memorial was designed by architect Alfred Preis, an Austrian-born resident who lived in Honolulu and was placed at a detainment camp after the Pearl Harbor attack as part of the internment policy of Japanese and German Americans at the time.

[PAR] Return to Paradise Island [PAR] The land is ravaged by war, and Queen Hippolyte lies comatose and tormented. An Amazon reveals that Ares, his sister Eris, and his sons Diemos and Phobus came to Hippolyte and demanded the secret of dimensional travel so that they could travel to Earth and plunge it into bloody war. Hippolyte refused, and battle ensued, in which the Amazons were defeated. But Hippolyte still withheld the secret, whereupon Eris cursed her with a nightmare sleep that would only end when her secret was wrested from her.

But none of them wish to go to war again, even after Diana tells them Mars is on the march again. A fight begins between Diana and Siegfried, but the Valkyrie Brunhilde stops it and tells Diana she and her Valkyries would be proud to aid the Amazons. Thus, Diana returns with the Nordic war-women and begin their final engagement with Mars\u2019s forces.

[PAR] Describe what the sound barrier is. [PAR] Questions [PAR] What conclusion can you draw about the speed of sound relative to the speed of light? [PAR] Sound and speed [PAR] If you have ever been to a baseball game or sat far away from the stage during a concert, you may have noticed something odd. You saw the batter hit the ball, but did not hear the crack of the impact until a few seconds later. Or, you saw the drummer strike the drum, but it took an extra moment before you heard it. This is because the speed of sound is slower than the speed of light, which we are used to seeing. The same thing is at work during a thunderstorm. Lightning and thunder both happen at the same time. We see the lightning almost instantaneously, but it takes longer to hear the thunder. Based on how much longer it takes to hear thunder tells us how far away the storm is. The longer it takes to hear the thunder, the farther the distance its sound had to travel and the farther away the storm is. [PAR] The sound barrier [PAR] The speed of sound through warm air at sea level has been measured at 346 meters per second or 0.346 km per second. That is the same as a car traveling about 780 miles per hour! Even most jet airplanes do not travel that fast. When a plane does go faster than speed of sound, it is said to break the sound barrier and a sonic boom is produced. On October 14, 1947, Chuck Yeager did just that. In a small plane called the X-1, he was the first person to fly faster than the speed of sound and the listeners on the ground were the first to hear the loud shock wave of a sonic boom. [PAR] Why do we see lightning before the thunder? [PAR] The flash of light from lightning travels at about 300,000 kilometers per second or 186,000 miles per second. This is why we see it so much sooner than we hear the thunder. If lightning occurs a kilometer away, the light arrives almost immediately (1/300,000 of a second) but it takes sound nearly 3 seconds to arrive. If you prefer to think in terms of miles, it takes sound nearly 5 seconds to travel 1 mile. Next time you see lightning count the number of seconds before the thunder arrives, then divide this number by 5 to find out how far away the lightning is.

The screenplay by Frank Cottrell Boyce is often claimed to have been based on the memoir A Genius in the Family (later republished under the title 'Hilary and Jackie') by Piers and Hilary du Pr\u00e9,  which chronicles the life and career of their late sister, cellist Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9. [PAR] In fact it was not, as the book had not yet been written; an 'Inside Film' programme, handed out at early showings of the film quotes screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce as saying,\"Hilary was working on the book at the same time as I was working on the film ... it was at a very early stage when we were doing the script.\"  The film was instead based on conversations with Hilary and Piers; unlike the book it does not claim to be the true story, and contains some made-up incidents. This is important, as the film attracted controversy and criticism for allegedly distorting details in Jacqueline's life, although Hilary du Pr\u00e9 publicly defended her version of the story.   [PAR] Emily Watson was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and Rachel Griffiths was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. [PAR] Plot [PAR] The film is divided into two sections, the first telling events from Hilary's point of view and the second from Jackie's. It opens with Hilary and Jackie as children being taught by their mother to dance and play musical instruments, the cello for Jackie and the flute for Hilary. Jackie does not take practising seriously at first, but when she does, she becomes a virtuoso, quickly rising to international prominence. Marriage to pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim follows. [PAR] Hilary, on the other hand, plays in a community orchestra and marries Christopher Finzi, the son of composer Gerald Finzi. The film, though focused primarily on Jacqueline, is ultimately about the relationship between the two sisters and their dedication to one another; to help Jacqueline through a nervous breakdown and in the interest of therapy, Hilary consents to Jacqueline having an affair with her (Hilary's) husband. [PAR] The last quarter of the movie chronicles in detail the last fifteen years of Jacqueline's life: she is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, loses control of her nervous system, becomes paralysed, goes deaf and mute, and finally dies. The film ends with Jacqueline's spirit standing on the beach where she used to play as a child, watching herself and her sister frolicking in the sand as little girls.

Credit: Laski Diffusion/Liaison. [PAR] On the morning of April 28, 1986, radiation detectors began spiking off the charts at the Forsmark nuclear power plant in the Uppland region in east-central Sweden. The obvious and terrifying initial conclusion: somehow, the plant\u2019s safety systems had failed, releasing radioactive material into the surrounding environment. But as engineers ran one diagnostic after another, it quickly became clear that the problem lay elsewhere \u2014 and while the government tried to deny it at first, \"elsewhere\" was soon revealed to be Reactor no. 4 at the Chernobyl power plant near the town of Pripyat, in Ukraine, which was then part of the Soviet Union. [PAR] Engineers at Chernobyl had been performing a systems test on the antiquated reactor when a power surge triggered explosions, followed by a raging fire in the exposed reactor core, spewing radioactive smoke and soot in a massive plume that spread north and west to contaminate a huge expanse of territory, most of it in the former U.S.S.R. The radioactive plume eventually hitched a ride via prevailing winds and circled the globe, although most regions were not exposed to unsafe radiation levels. [PAR] The explosion itself, and the searing radioactivity that bathed plant workers and emergency crews who desperately fought the fire, killed 64 people outright; a massive evacuation began that eventually forced hundreds of thousands of people to move out of affected areas; and the Soviet government, under intense international pressure, soon came clean about a disaster it couldn\u2019t possibly hush up. Indeed, then-premier Mikhail Gorbachev later acknowledged that the accident forced him to get serious about his fledgling policy of \u201c glasnost ,\u201d or openness. Chernobyl, he has suggested, was the straw that finally broke the back of the Soviet Union. [PAR] It was all so momentous, but also so long ago that it seems like a part of history \u2014 a relic of the Cold War, along with the Vietnam War, the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Berlin Wall. But while the worst nuclear accident on record began during the Reagan administration, it didn\u2019t end then, or during the first Bush administration, or Clinton, or even the Presidency of George W. Bush. The reactor site itself is still highly radioactive, and the cleanup, even a quarter of a century later, continues. Ukrainian and international officials haven\u2019t yet figured out how to secure the most highly radioactive debris in a safe and permanent way. And the accident\u2019s toll on the people and ecosystems of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, where the radioactive fallout mostly settled, is still unfolding .

Children from areas near the Chernobyl nuclear plant have suffered from leukemia & other ailments believed to be result of exposure to radiation emitted in 1986.

It was pretty straightforward to count the fatalities from the blast itself, and from the intense bath of radioactivity that doused the first responders; acute radiation sickness is grimly easy to diagnose. But while it\u2019s well known that radioactivity can also cause cancer, only thyroid cancer has been definitively linked to ingesting contaminated food in the fallout zone. By 2002, according to a U.N.-sponsored report titled \" Chernobyl\u2019s Legacy: Health, Environmental and Socioeconomic Impacts ,\" more than 4,000 children who drank radioactive milk soon after the accident ultimately came down with this generally treatable disease. [PAR] The radioactive iodine released in nuclear accidents, including the one still going on at the Fukushima complex in Japan , decays to harmless levels within a few weeks.

Although born in Perth, he grew up in Fife and spent many summer holidays with his grandparents in Broughton in the Borders, developing a love of walking and the Borders scenery and wildlife that is often featured in his novels. [PAR] After attending Hutchesons' Grammar School, Buchan won a scholarship to the University of Glasgow where he studied Classics and wrote poetry and first became a published author. He then studied Literae Humaniores at Brasenose College , Oxford , winning the Newdigate prize for poetry. He had a genius for friendship which he retained all his life. His friends at Oxford included Hilaire Belloc , Raymond Asquith and Aubrey Herbert . [PAR] Life as an author and politician [PAR] Buchan at first entered into a career in law in 1901 , but almost immediately moved into politics, becoming private secretary to British colonial administrator Alfred Milner , who was High Commissioner for South Africa , the Governor of Cape Colony and colonial administrator of the Transvaal and of the Orange Free State . Buchan gained an acquaintance with the country that was to feature prominently in his writing. On his return to London, he became a partner in a publishing company while he continued to write books. Buchan married Susan Charlotte Grosvenor ( 1882 - 1977 ), cousin of the Duke of Westminster , on July 15, 1907 . Together they had four children, two of whom would spend most of their lives in Canada. [PAR] In 1910 , he wrote Prester John , the first of his adventure novels, set in South Africa . In 1911 , he first suffered from duodenal ulcers, an illness he would give to one of his characters in later books. He also entered politics running as a Tory candidate for a Border constituency. During this time Buchan supported Free Trade, woman's suffrage, national insurance and curtailing the power of the House of Lords . However he opposed the Liberal reforms of 1905 - 1915 and what he considered the class hatred fostered by demagogic Liberals like David Lloyd George . [PAR] During World War I, he wrote for the War Propaganda Bureau and was a correspondent for The Times in France . In 1915 , he published his most famous book The Thirty Nine Steps , a spy thriller set just before the outbreak of World War I ], featuring his hero Richard Hannay, who was based on a friend from South African days, Edmund Ironside. The following year he published a sequel Greenmantle . In 1916 , he joined the British Army Intelligence Corps where as a 2nd Lieutenant he wrote speeches and communiques for Sir Douglas Haig . [PAR] In 1917 , he returned to Britain where he became Director of Information under Lord Beaverbrook .

This attachment, also known as national feeling or national pride, can be viewed in terms of different features relating to one's own nation, including ethnic, cultural, political or historical aspects. It encompasses a set of concepts closely related to those of nationalism.    An excess of patriotism in the defense of a nation is called chauvinism; another related term is jingoism. [PAR] The English term patriot is first attested in the Elizabethan era, via Middle French from Late Latin (6th century) patriota, meaning \"countryman\", ultimately , .  The abstract noun patriotism appears in the early 18th century.  [PAR] History [PAR] The general notion of civic virtue and group dedication has been attested in culture globally throughout the historical period. For the Enlightenment thinkers of 18th-century Europe, loyalty to the state was chiefly considered in contrast to loyalty to the Church. It was argued that clerics should not be allowed to teach in public schools since their patrie was heaven, so that they could not inspire love of the homeland in their students. One of the most influential proponents of this classical notion of patriotism was Jean-Jacques Rousseau. [PAR] Enlightenment thinkers also criticized what they saw as the excess of patriotism. In 1774, Samuel Johnson published The Patriot, a critique of what he viewed as false patriotism. On the evening of 7 April 1775, he made the famous statement, \"Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.\"  James Boswell, who reported this comment in his Life of Johnson, does not provide context for the quote, and it has therefore been argued that Johnson was in fact attacking the false use of the term \"patriotism\" by contemporaries such as John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute (the patriot-minister) and his supporters; Johnson spoke elsewhere in favor of what he considered \"true\" patriotism.  However, there is no direct evidence to contradict the widely held belief that Johnson's famous remark was a criticism of patriotism itself. [PAR] Patriotism is the will of the members of a country to support the country and help it continue. [PAR] Philosophical issues [PAR] Patriotism may be strengthened by adherence to a national religion (a civil religion or even a theocracy). This is the opposite of the separation of church and state demanded by the Enlightenment thinkers who saw patriotism and faith as similar and opposed forces. Michael Billig and Jean Bethke Elshtain have both argued that the difference between patriotism and faith is difficult to discern and relies largely on the attitude of the one doing the labelling.  [PAR] Christopher Heath Wellman,  professor of philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis, describes that a popular view of the \"patriotist\" position is robust obligations to compatriots and only minimal samaritan responsibilities to foreigners.  Wellman calls this position \"patriotist\" rather than \"nationalist\" to single out the members of territorial, political units rather than cultural groups. [PAR] Marxism [PAR] Marxists have taken various stances regarding patriotism. On one hand, Karl Marx famously stated that \"The working men have no country\"  and that \"the supremacy of the proletariat will cause them [national differences] to vanish still faster.\" The same view is promoted by present-day Trotskyists such as Alan Woods, who is \"in favour of tearing down all frontiers and creating a socialist world commonwealth.\"  [PAR] On the other hand, Stalinists and Maoists are usually in favour of socialist patriotism based on the theory of socialism in one country.  [PAR] Region-specific issues [PAR] In the European Union, thinkers such as J\u00fcrgen Habermas have advocated a \"Euro-patriotism\", but patriotism in Europe is usually directed at the nation-state and more often than not coincides with \"Euroscepticism\". [PAR] Surveys [PAR] Several surveys have tried to measure patriotism for various reasons, such as the Correlates of War project which found some correlation between war propensity and patriotism. The results from different studies are time dependent. For example, patriotism in Germany before World War I ranked at or near the top, whereas today it ranks at or near the bottom of patriotism surveys.

He obtained a diploma, which  was endorsed by the Faculty of the Medical College of Philadelphia, and  in 1885 Crippen acquired another diploma, as an eye and ear specialist,  from the Ophthalmic Hospital in New York. These qualifications were not  sufficient for Crippen to practice as a Doctor in the UK. [PAR] After Crippen's  first visit to England he wandered about the USA, practising in a number  of larger cities. In Utah, during 1890 or 1891, his wife died, and he  sent is 3 year old son to live with her late wife's Mother in California.  During one of his stays in New York he married again. His second wife  was a girl of 17 years old whom Crippen knew as Cora Turner. Her real  name was Kunigunde Mackamotski, her Father being a Russian Pole and her  Mother German. There were more wanderings: St. Louis, New York and Philadelphia,  with a short visit across the border to Toronto. The Munyon Company, a  patent medicine company, now employed Crippen. Mrs. Crippen, who was deluded  by her modest singing talent, travelled to New York for opera training.

In 1902 Munyon's recalled him for  six months in Philadelphia. Mrs. Crippen had been seeking music-hall work,  with slight success. During one of her music engagements, she met an American  music-hall performer called Bruce Miller (who later testified at the trial).

Some of them failed, and presently he eventually returned to Munyon's,  who had relocated to Albion House, New Oxford Street. In Albion House,  when Munyon's business began to decline, Crippen was also in partnership  with another firm: The Yale Tooth Specialists. While working here, Crippen  employed as his typist Ethel le Neve. He had first met her when they had  been working for one of Crippen's business failures: The Drouet Institute.  Although Crippen took over the Munyon's office on a franchise basis, he  failed to halt Munyon's decline and Crippen ended his 16 year relationship  with the Munyon firm on 31 January 1910.

Chuck Berry\u2019s music infused a cross-section of styles including Rockabilly, Country, Blues, and Rhythm & Blues, crafting his own original Rock and Roll sound that would be often imitated by British rock groups in the 1960s. [PAR] In addition to  blending together these genres, Berry wrote lyrics reflecting teens and young adults interests, performing his danceable songs with an over-the-top showmanship and guitar solos that would go on to define rock music for years to come. Some say Chuck Berry is one of the greatest rock lyricists, perhaps because the songs he recorded were full of humor and satire. [PAR] Born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1926, Berry grew up interested in music but living a working-class life until he first picked up a guitar in the early 1950s.  In 1955 Chuck got his big break on a trip to Chicago, where Muddy Waters referred Berry to popular blues music label Chess Records, where Berry recorded many of his early hits including his first number one hit song \u201cMaybellene\u201d , followed by \u201cRock and Roll Music\u201d and \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d . Berry\u2019s 1957 hit \u201cRoll over Beethoven\u201d was a watershed in music history, a song whose lyrics points to where Rock and Roll became the dominant music genre as teenagers gained independence over the music of their parent\u2019s generation. [PAR] By the end of the 1950s Chuck Berry was already a successful touring performer, but his career took a second wind in the 1960s with new hits such as \u201cNadine\u201d , \u201cNo Particular Place To Go\u201d , and \u201cYou Never Can Tell\u201d .  Around this time his guitar style began to show its influence on many of the British groups in the 60\u2019s, including The Beatles and the Rolling Stones . In fact during the later years of Berry\u2019s career he toured as a nostalgia rock performer, alongside musicians who drew inspiration from his playing style, such as John Lennon:[DOC] [TLE] Chuck Berry - - Classic Rock BandsChuck Berry [PAR] Chuck Berry [PAR] Charles Edward Anderson Berry was born on October 18, 1926 in St. Louis, MO. His mother, Martha, was qualified as a schoolteacher. His father, Henry, was a contractor and deacon of the nearby Antioch Baptist Church. The third of six children, he grew up in \"The Ville\", an area just north of downtown St. Louis which was one of the few areas in the city where Blacks could own property. Consequently, during the 1920s and '30s, The Ville became synonymous with Black prosperity. Berry grew up attending Simmons Grade School and Sumner High School, the first Black high school west of the Mississippi. As a teenager, Chuck developed an interest for the guitar. With local Jazz guitarist Ira Harris as an early teacher, Berry learned the rudiments of the instrument on a four-string tenor guitar. By 1950 however, he had changed over to a six-string electric. Two years later Berry began playing professional engagements in St. Louis clubs. [PAR] Berry got his first taste of stardom, singing Jay McShann's \"Confessin' the Blues\" in the All Men's Review in 1941; it was a song he was later to record on the 1960 album \"Rockin' at the Hops\". But music was not his only focus at that time. When not working with his father, Berry began to cultivate a lifelong interest in photography through his cousin Harry Davis. Before he could graduate from high school, Berry encountered his first problem with the law. In 1944, on a joy ride to Kansas City, Berry and two companions were arrested and found guilty of armed robbery. Each was sentenced to 10 years in the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men at Algoa, Missouri. At Algoa, drawing on his Baptist roots, Berry joined a Gospel group.

It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \"Third Coast\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \"south coast\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \"north coast.\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin. [PAR] The Gulf of Mexico formed approximately 300 million years ago as a result of plate tectonics.  The Gulf's basin is roughly oval and is approximately 810 nmi wide and floored by sedimentary rocks and recent sediments. It is connected to part of the Atlantic Ocean through the Florida Straits between the U.S. and Cuba, and with the Caribbean Sea (with which it forms the American Mediterranean Sea) via the Yucatan Channel between Mexico and Cuba. With the narrow connection to the Atlantic, the Gulf experiences very small tidal ranges. The size of the Gulf basin is approximately 1.6 million km2 (615,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Almost half of the basin is shallow continental shelf waters. The basin contains a volume of roughly 2,500 quadrillion liters (550 quadrillion Imperial gallons, 660 quadrillion US gallons, 2.5 million km3 or 600,000 cu mi).  [PAR] Extent [PAR] The International Hydrographic Organization defines the southeast limit of the Gulf of Mexico as follows:  [PAR] A line leaving Cape Catoche Light () with the Light on Cape San Antonio in Cuba, through this island to the meridian of 83\u00b0W and to the Northward along this meridian to the latitude of the South point of the Dry Tortugas (24\u00b035'N), along this parallel Eastward to Rebecca Shoal (82\u00b035'W) thence through the shoals and Florida Keys to the mainland at eastern end of Florida Bay, all the narrow waters between the Dry Tortugas and the mainland being considered to be within the Gulf. [PAR] Geology [PAR] The consensus among geologists   who have studied the geology of the Gulf of Mexico, is that prior to the Late Triassic, the Gulf of Mexico did not exist. Before the Late Triassic, the area now occupied by the Gulf of Mexico consisted of dry land, which included continental crust that now underlies Yucatan, within the middle of the large supercontinent of Pangea. This land lay south of a continuous mountain range that extended from north-central Mexico, through the Marathon Uplift in West Texas and the Ouachita Mountains of Oklahoma, and to Alabama where it linked directly to the Appalachian Mountains. It was created by the collision of continental plates that formed Pangea. As interpreted by Roy Van Arsdale and Randel T. Cox, this mountain range was breached in Late Cretaceous times by the formation of the Mississippi Embayment.   [PAR] Geologists and other Earth scientists agree in general that the present Gulf of Mexico basin originated in Late Triassic time as the result of rifting within Pangea. The rifting was associated with zones of weakness within Pangea, including sutures where the Laurentia, South American, and African plates collided to create it. First, there was a Late Triassic-Early Jurassic phase of rifting during which rift valleys formed and filled with continental red beds. Second, as rifting progressed through Early and Middle Jurassic time, continental crust was stretched and thinned. This thinning created a broad zone of thick transitional crust, which displays modest and uneven thinning with block faulting, and a broad zone of uniformly thinned transitional crust, which is half the typical thickness, 35 kilometers, of normal continental crust. It was at this time that tectonics first created a connection to the Pacific Ocean across central Mexico and later eastward to the Atlantic Ocean. This flooded the subsiding basin created by rifting and crustal thinning to create the Gulf of Mexico. While the Gulf of Mexico was a restricted basin, the subsiding transitional crust was blanketed by the widespread deposition of Louann Salt and associated anhydrite evaporites.

You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking it was longer. Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas?, the charity single that led to the concert, feels like it has been remade at least 73 times since 1984, with diminishing returns. Last year\u2019s version, by Band Aid 30, successfully raised more millions, this time for the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, but it was dogged by a sense of increasing discomfiture about whether white Western pop stars singing about feeding the world was the best way to help humanitarian crises on another continent. Organiser Sir Bob Geldof was forced to admit that everyone was sick of the song and it was probably the last time they should do it. [PAR] The 1985 Live Aid concert, held six months after the Christmas single was released, has been repeated only once, in 2005. Rebranded and scheduled to coincide with the G8 conference on global poverty, Live8 was arguably an even bigger deal than Live Aid, with 10 simultaneous global concerts, compared with the original\u2019s two, and broadcast to double the audience \u2013 three billion people around the world. [PAR] Yet I dare you to name one standout performance from it: Madonna, perhaps, mostly because she was wearing that funny white waistcoat? Elton John and Pete Doherty\u2019s unusual interpretation of Children of the Revolution, possibly? Even Geldof admitted last year that \u201cpeople don\u2019t really remember Live8, and that was far bigger\u201d. Best not to even try to recall Farm Aid or Live Earth then. [PAR] No matter how far in the distant past, one thing Live Aid wasn\u2019t was forgettable. Along with the wedding of Charles and Diana and the fall of the Berlin Wall, the event was one of the TV landmarks of the Eighties. I remember the excitement of shutting the curtains against the hot sun and just watching the box for the rest of the day. It was like Christmas, only better. [PAR] Even in that indulgent reverie back then, it was not a flawless concert, littered with dodgy moments \u2013 Adam Ant\u2019s shambling turn, Simon Le Bon\u2019s bum note, the sound cutting out on Paul McCartney \u2013 but compared to most music broadcasts it had the sense of something real and more intensely \u201clive\u201d than any concert that had been shown on TV before. [PAR] There was the thrill to the constant sense of uncertainty and the unscripted happening: Princess Diana forcing Prince Charles into some awkward dancing, Bob Geldof losing his rag and demanding our money, Mick Jagger ripping away Tina Turner\u2019s dress. [PAR] But mostly it was the performances that cracked through the screen, particularly Queen and U2. No matter how mainstream the programme was designed to be, it bristled with a very British, almost punkish amateurism. [PAR] Queen's Freddie Mercury performs during the 1985 LIve Aid Concert in Wembley [PAR] In some ways, it seems like it was the final fanfare of the music industry at its most imperial, typified by Noel Edmonds \u2013 the Chris Evans of his day \u2013 dropping Phil Collins off in a helicopter so he could fly on Concorde to Live Aid\u2019s other concert that day, in Philadelphia. Adam Ant has subsequently derided it as the moment rock \u2019n\u2019 roll died \u2013 a touch of sour grapes, perhaps, but even without giving birth to the industry of charity endorsement and the idea of pop stars as Establishment figures, within the next 10 years the underground sounds of indie, dance and rap music, and the imminent onslaught of the internet, would mean that Live Aid represented one of the final moments when the world seemed in a kind of reverence of pop music and its stars.

In 1990, it separated into three political parties: [PAR] * the Green Party of England and Wales [PAR] * the Scottish Green Party [PAR] * the Green Party in Northern Ireland [PAR] Despite the UK Green Party no longer existing as an entity, \"Green Party\" (singular) is still used in most media to refer collectively to all of the Green Party of England and Wales, the Scottish Green Party and the Green Party in Northern Ireland, for example in reporting opinion polls and election results. [PAR] People, 1973\u20131975 [PAR] An interview with overpopulation expert Paul R. Ehrlich in Playboy magazine inspired a small group of professional & business people to form the 'Club of Thirteen', so named because it first met on 13 October 1972 in Daventry. This included surveyors and property agents Freda Sanders and Michael Benfield, Jitendrakumar Patel (1950-2016) and husband and wife solicitors Lesley and Tony Whittaker (a former Kenilworth councillor for the Conservative Party), all with practices in Coventry. Many in this 'club' were wary of forming a political party so, after a few weeks, in November 1972 these four agreed to form 'PEOPLE' as a new political party to challenge the UK political establishment.  Its policy concerns published in 1973 included economics, employment, defence, energy (fuel) supplies, land tenure, pollution and social security, as then seen within an ecological perspective. Subsequently recognised as perhaps the world's earliest Green party this had the first edition of the Manifesto for a Sustainable Society as a background statement of policies inspired by A Blueprint for Survival (published by The Ecologist magazine). The editor of The Ecologist, Edward 'Teddy' Goldsmith, merged his 'Movement for Survival' with PEOPLE.

Furthermore, the effect of the \"revolution of values\" during the 1960s would come later. In Wall's eyes, the party suffered from a lack of media attention and \"opposition from many environmentalists\", which contrasted the experience of other emerging Green parties, like Germany's Die Gr\u00fcnen. Nonetheless, PEOPLE invested much of its resources in engaging with the indifferent environmental movement, which Wall calls a \"tactical mistake\". [PAR] In 1973 policy concerns included economics, employment, defence, energy (fuel) supplies, land tenure, pollution and social security, as then seen within an ecological perspective.  \"Zero growth\" (or \"steady state\") economics were a strong feature in the party's philosophical basis.

Each of these states is made up of particles that move by different amounts. [PAR] State Changes [PAR] All solids, liquids and gases are made of particles. The only difference between them is  how much energy the particles have.  If you give the particles energy; or take energy away from them; then you can change their  state. [PAR] If you heat up a solid - you give it some energy.  This causes the particles to move more and the solid to change into a  liquid, or melt. If the liquid is heated then it may evaporate and turn into a gas. [PAR] Taking energy away from a gas (cooling it down) may cause it to turn into a liquid - or condense. Further  cooling of the liquid may cause it to turn into a solid - or freeze. [PAR] Now answer these questions ... [PAR] What are solids, liquids and gases made out of ?

There  isn't an increase in temperature because the energy is all used in changing the particles from a solid to a liquid. [PAR] The same thing happens when the particles change from a liquid to a gas - at first the heat given to the liquid just causes  it to warm up.

Mickey Mouse was created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks [1] . He was voiced by Walt Disney from 1928\u20131946 theatrically, and again from 1955\u20131959 for the original ABC TV The Mickey Mouse Club , Daily's Pets television series. The Walt Disney Company celebrates his birth as November 18, 1928, upon the release of Steamboat Willie , [2] although Mickey had already appeared six months earlier in an unfinished test screening of Plane Crazy [3] (Steamboat Willie being the first Mickey Mouse Cartoon to be released). The anthropomorphic mouse has evolved from being simply a character in animated cartoons and comic strips to become one of the most recognizable symbols in the world. Mickey is currently the main character in the Disney Channel 's Disney Junior series \" Mickey Mouse Clubhouse \". Mickey is the leader of The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse , with help from Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and other friendly friends of his.

Mintz owned Oswald and thought he had Disney over a barrel. Angrily, Disney refused the deal and returned to produce the final Oswald cartoons he contractually owed Mintz. Disney was dismayed at the betrayal by his staff, but determined to restart from scratch. The new Disney Studio initially consisted of animator Ub Iwerks and a loyal apprentice artist, Les Clark . One lesson Disney learned from the experience was to thereafter always make sure that he owned all rights to the characters produced by his company. [PAR] In the spring of 1928, Disney asked Ub Iwerks to start drawing up new character ideas. Iwerks tried sketches of various animals, such as dogs and cats, but none of these appealed to Disney. A female cow and male horse were also rejected. They would later turn up as Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar .

The studio was founded in 1919 by D.\u00a0W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks with the intention of controlling their own interests rather than depending upon the powerful commercial studios.  [PAR] An incarnation of United Artists was formed in November 2006 as a partnership between producer/actor Tom Cruise and his production partner, Paula Wagner, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Paula Wagner left the studio on August 14, 2008.  Cruise owned a small stake in the studio until late 2011.  [PAR] In 2014, MGM acquired controlling interest in Mark Burnett and Roma Downey's entertainment companies One Three Media and Lightworkers Media, then merged them to revive United Artists' TV production unit as United Artists Media Group (UAMG). On December 14, 2015, MGM acquired the 45% stake of UAMG it did not own and folded it into MGM Television. [PAR] History [PAR] The early years [PAR] UA was incorporated as a joint venture on February 5, 1919, by four of the leading figures in early Hollywood: Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, and D. W. Griffith. Each held a 20% stake, with the remaining 20% held by lawyer William Gibbs McAdoo.  The idea for the venture originated with Fairbanks, Chaplin, Pickford, and cowboy star William\u00a0S. Hart a year earlier as they were traveling around the U.S. selling Liberty bonds to help America's World War\u00a0I efforts. Already Hollywood veterans, the four film stars began to talk of forming their own company to better control their own work as well as their futures. [PAR] They were spurred on by established Hollywood producers and distributors who were tightening their control over actor salaries and creative decisions, a process that evolved into the rigid studio system. With the addition of Griffith, planning began, but Hart bowed out before anything was formalized. When he heard about their scheme, Richard A. Rowland, head of Metro Pictures, is said to have observed, \"The inmates are taking over the asylum.\" The four partners, with advice from McAdoo (son-in-law and former Treasury Secretary of then-President Woodrow Wilson), formed their distribution company, with Hiram Abrams as its first managing director. Its headquarters was established at 729 Seventh Avenue in New York City.  [PAR] The original terms called for Pickford, Fairbanks, Griffith, and Chaplin to produce five pictures each year independently. But by the time the company was up and running in 1920\u20131921, feature films were becoming more expensive and polished, and running times had settled at around ninety minutes (or eight reels). It was believed that no one, no matter how popular, could produce and star in five quality feature films a year.   [PAR] UA's first film (His Majesty, the American by and starring Fairbanks) was a success. There was limited funding for movies at the time. Without selling stock to the public, like the other studios of the time, all United had to work with was weekly prepayment installments from theater owners for upcoming movies. As a result, production was slow and the company distributed an annual average of five films during the first five years of its existence. [PAR] By 1924, Griffith had dropped out, and the company was facing a crisis: either bring in others to help support a costly distribution system or concede defeat. Veteran producer Joseph Schenck was hired as president. Not only had he been producing pictures for a decade, but he brought along commitments for films starring his wife, Norma Talmadge, his sister-in-law, Constance Talmadge, and his brother-in-law, Buster Keaton. Contracts were signed with a number of independent producers, most notably Samuel Goldwyn, and Howard Hughes. In 1933, Schenck organized a new company with Darryl\u00a0F. Zanuck, Twentieth Century Pictures, which soon provided four pictures a year to UA's schedule and was half the schedule.

[PAR] Plants use a process called photosynthesis to make food. During photosynthesis, plants trap light energy with their leaves.  Plants use the energy of the sun to change water and carbon dioxide into a sugar called glucose. Glucose is used by plants for energy and to make other substances like cellulose and starch.  Cellulose is used in building cell walls. Starch is stored in seeds and other plant parts as a food source. That's why some foods that we eat, like rice and grains, are packed with starch!

This pigment is found in special cell organelles called chloroplasts and it is also found in some special anaerobic bacteria called cyanobacteria. Chloroplasts are found only in the cells of the leaves of green plants. [PAR] Full Answer [PAR] During the daytime, when sunlight falls on green leaves, it traps the solar energy and converts it into simple carbohydrates such as glucose and starch. Thus, it helps to convert solar energy into chemical form. [PAR] This process is called photosynthesis and takes place only in green plants. For photosynthesis to take place, carbon dioxide and water vapor are also necessary.

They are also found in the cells of other organisms that use photosynthesis. Chloroplasts take the energy from the sunlight and use it to make plant food. The food can be used immediately to give cells energy or it can be stored as sugar or starch. If stored, it can be used later when the plant needs to do work, like grow a new branch or make a flower. [PAR] Chloroplasts up close [PAR] Inside chloroplasts are special stacks of pancake-shaped structures called thylakoids (Greek thylakos = sack or pouch). Thylakoids have an outer membrane that surrounds an inner area called the lumen. The light-dependent reactions happen inside the thylakoid.

The shackles Ruby wore when dying at Dallas\u2019 Parkland Memorial Hospital sold for over $11,000, while an X-ray of Ruby's head went for more than $700. [PAR] Ruby, one of eight siblings, had a troubled childhood in Chicago and spent time in foster care. He never graduated from high school and spent years working odd jobs, including as a door-to-door salesman and ticket scalper. During World War II , Ruby served in the Army Air Forces, working as an aircraft mechanic at U.S. bases. By the late 1940s, he had moved to Dallas, where he became a small-time operator in the world of nightclubs and gambling. He also racked up a series of arrests for minor offenses. [PAR] Ruby had fringe connections to organized crime and a reputation as a name-dropper and publicity seeker. He never married and possessed no known political affiliations. [PAR] The Kennedy Assassination [PAR] On November 22, 1963, President Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline (1929-1994) were riding with Texas Governor John Connally (1917-1993) and his wife in an open limousine in a presidential motorcade through downtown Dallas. As their vehicle passed the Texas School Book Depository Building at 12:30 p.m., Lee Harvey Oswald, who had started working at the building the previous month, allegedly fired three shots from the sixth floor, fatally wounding the 46-year-old president and seriously injuring Governor Connally. Kennedy was pronounced dead 30 minutes later at Dallas\u2019 Parkland Memorial Hospital. Less than an hour after Kennedy was shot, Oswald killed a policeman, J.D. Tippit (1924-1963), who questioned him on the street near his Dallas rooming house. A short time later, police arrested Oswald, a Louisiana native and ex-Marine who lived for a time in the Soviet Union, at a movie theater. He denied killing Tippit and Kennedy, but was soon arraigned on charges of murdering both men. [PAR] Jack Ruby Kills Lee Harvey Oswald [PAR] On November 24, a crowd of reporters, policemen and camera crews gathered to watch as Oswald was brought to the basement of the Dallas city jail en route to a waiting car scheduled to transfer him to the county jail. As a handcuffed Oswald, flanked by detectives, came into view, Jack Ruby, stocky, balding and wearing a dark suit and gray fedora, lunged forward from the crowd. At approximately 11:20 a.m., Ruby fatally wounded Oswald with a single shot to the abdomen from a concealed .38-caliber Colt Cobra revolver. Television cameras captured the attack, which was witnessed live by Americans across the country. The shooter, wrestled to the ground by police, shouted, \u201cYou all know me.

Not only were the royal coffers depleted, but two decades of poor cereal harvests, drought, cattle disease and skyrocketing bread prices had kindled unrest among peasants and the urban poor. Many expressed their desperation and resentment toward a regime that imposed heavy taxes yet failed to provide relief by rioting, looting and striking. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] Over 17,000 people were officially tried and executed during the Reign of Terror, and an unknown number of others died in prison or without trial. [PAR] In the fall of 1786, Louis XVI\u2019s controller general, Charles Alexandre de Calonne (1734-1802), proposed a financial reform package that included a universal land tax from which the privileged classes would no longer be exempt. To garner support for these measures and forestall a growing aristocratic revolt, the king summoned the Estates-General (\u201cles \u00e9tats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux\u201d)\u2013an assembly representing France\u2019s clergy, nobility and middle class\u2013for the first time since 1614. The meeting was scheduled for May 5, 1789; in the meantime, delegates of the three estates from each locality would compile lists of grievances (\u201ccahiers de dol\u00e9ances\u201d) to present to the king. [PAR] The French Revolution at Versailles: Rise of the Third Estate [PAR] France\u2019s population had changed considerably since 1614. The non-aristocratic members of the Third Estate now represented 98 percent of the people but could still be outvoted by the other two bodies. In the lead-up to the May 5 meeting, the Third Estate began to mobilize support for equal representation and the abolishment of the noble veto\u2013in other words, they wanted voting by head and not by status. While all of the orders shared a common desire for fiscal and judicial reform as well as a more representative form of government, the nobles in particular were loath to give up the privileges they enjoyed under the traditional system. [PAR] By the time the Estates-General convened at Versailles, the highly public debate over its voting process had erupted into hostility between the three orders, eclipsing the original purpose of the meeting and the authority of the man who had convened it. On June 17, with talks over procedure stalled, the Third Estate met alone and formally adopted the title of National Assembly; three days later, they met in a nearby indoor tennis court and took the so-called Tennis Court Oath (\u201cserment du jeu de paume\u201d), vowing not to disperse until constitutional reform had been achieved. Within a week, most of the clerical deputies and 47 liberal nobles had joined them, and on June 27 Louis XVI grudgingly absorbed all three orders into the new assembly. [PAR] The French Revolution Hits the Streets: The Bastille and the Great Fear [PAR] On June 12, as the National Assembly (known as the National Constituent Assembly during its work on a constitution) continued to meet at Versailles, fear and violence consumed the capital. Though enthusiastic about the recent breakdown of royal power, Parisians grew panicked as rumors of an impending military coup began to circulate. A popular insurgency culminated on July 14 when rioters stormed the Bastille fortress in an attempt to secure gunpowder and weapons; many consider this event, now commemorated in France as a national holiday, as the start of the French Revolution. [PAR] The wave of revolutionary fervor and widespread hysteria quickly swept the countryside. Revolting against years of exploitation, peasants looted and burned the homes of tax collectors, landlords and the seigniorial elite. Known as the Great Fear (\u201cla Grande peur\u201d), the agrarian insurrection hastened the growing exodus of nobles from the country and inspired the National Constituent Assembly to abolish feudalism on August 4, 1789, signing what the historian Georges Lefebvre later called the \u201cdeath certificate of the old order.\u201d [PAR] The French Revolution\u2019s Political Culture: Drafting a Constitution [PAR] On August 4,\n\n\n### Answer:\nlouis xvi </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

The pass may be skirted by a road fork that enters the hills about 9 miles north of Jamr\u016bd and emerges at Lowyah Dakkah. [PAR] Few passes have had such continuing strategic importance or so many historic associations as the Khyber Pass. Through it have passed Persians, Greeks, Mughals, Afghans, and the British, for whom it was the key point in control of the Afghan border. In the 5th century bc Darius I the Great of Persia conquered the country around K\u0101bul and marched through the Khyber Pass to the Indus River . Two centuries later Hephaestion and Perdiccas, generals of Alexander the Great , probably used the pass. Buddhism flourished in and around the Khyber when it was part of A\u015boka\u2019s kingdom (3rd century bc); Buddhist remains include K\u0101fir Kot (Citadel of the Kafirs), Shopla st\u016bpa (also called the Khyber Top), and the st\u016bpa near Ali Masjid.

It is related to hemoglobin, which is the iron- and oxygen-binding protein in blood, specifically in the red blood cells. In humans, myoglobin is only found in the bloodstream after muscle injury. It is an abnormal finding, and can be diagnostically relevant when found in blood. [PAR]  (Google books link is the 2008 edition) [PAR] Myoglobin is the primary oxygen-carrying pigment of muscle tissues.  High concentrations of myoglobin in muscle cells allow organisms to hold their breath for a longer period of time. Diving mammals such as whales and seals have muscles with particularly high abundance of myoglobin. Myoglobin is found in Type I muscle, Type II A and Type II B, but most texts consider myoglobin not to be found in smooth muscle. [PAR] Myoglobin was the first protein to have its three-dimensional structure revealed by X-ray crystallography.  This achievement was reported in 1958 by John Kendrew and associates.  For this discovery, John Kendrew shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Max Perutz.  Despite being one of the most studied proteins in biology, its physiological function is not yet conclusively established: mice genetically engineered to lack myoglobin are viable, but showed a 30% reduction in volume of blood being pumped by the heart during a contraction.  They adapted to this deficiency through natural reactions to inadequate oxygen supply (hypoxia) and a widening of blood vessels (vasodilation).  In humans myoglobin is encoded by the MB gene.  [PAR] As hemoglobin can take the forms of oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO), and methemoglobin (met-Hb), so can myoglobin take the forms of oxymyoglobin (MbO2), carboxymyoglobin (MbCO), and metmyoglobin (met-Mb). [PAR] Differences from hemoglobin [PAR] Myoglobin is similar to hemoglobin in that it is involved in the transportation of oxygen to cells. There are many distinct differences that set the protein apart from hemoglobin. For one the protein has only one binding site for oxygen on the one heme group on the protein. While myoglobin can only hold one oxygen, the affinity for that oxygen is very high compared to hemoglobin. This is likely due to the fact that hemoglobin, transporting 4 oxygens to the tissues and muscles where myoglobin is mostly present. The myoglobin takes the oxygen from the hemoglobin (due to the Bohr Effect) and takes that oxygen to muscle cells for use in metabolic processes. [PAR] Meat color [PAR] Myoglobin contains hemes, pigments responsible for the color of red meat. The color that meat takes is partly determined by the degree of oxidation of the myoglobin. In fresh meat the iron atom is the ferrous (+2) oxidation state bound to an oxygen molecule (O2). Meat cooked well done is brown because the iron atom is now in the ferric (+3) oxidation state, having lost an electron. If meat has been exposed to nitrites, it will remain pink because the iron atom is bound to NO, nitric oxide (true of, e.g., corned beef or cured hams). Grilled meats can also take on a pink \"smoke ring\" that comes from the iron binding to a molecule of carbon monoxide.  Raw meat packed in a carbon monoxide atmosphere also shows this same pink \"smoke ring\" due to the same principles. Notably, the surface of this raw meat also displays the pink color, which is usually associated in consumers' minds with fresh meat. This artificially induced pink color can persist, reportedly up to one year.  Hormel and Cargill are both reported to use this meat-packing process, and meat treated this way has been in the consumer market since 2003.  [PAR] Role in disease [PAR] Myoglobin is released from damaged muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis), which has very high concentrations of myoglobin. The released myoglobin is filtered by the kidneys but is toxic to the renal tubular epithelium and so may cause acute kidney injury.

The official birth of the holiday took place in 1886 in Waterloo, New York.\u00a0 [PAR] Independence Day has been celebrated on the Fourth\u00a0of July since 1777, and it commemorates the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. [PAR] Labor Day marks the unofficial end of summer. It also marks the return to school for many children in the United States.\u00a0It was created to celebrate the achievements of workers in 1882. Its corollary in other countries is their May 1 Labor Day celebration. [PAR] Columbus Day recognizes the man traditionally credited with discovering the Americas. There are similar holidays in Latin American and Caribbean countries. The first Columbus Day celebration was held in New York in 1792. Since 1971, Columbus Day is commemorated on the second Monday in October; this is also Thanksgiving in Canada. Since 1966, the Muscular Dystrophy Association has held an annual telethon on this date. [PAR] Veterans Day honors all veterans of the United States armed forces and is also a state holiday in all 50 states.

Jericho, Palestinian Territories [PAR] The world\u2019s oldest continually-inhabited city, Jericho is a Palestinian city located near the Jordan River in the West Bank. It is the administrative seat of the Jericho Governorate. The city was occupied by Jordan from 1948 to 1967, and has been held under Israeli occupation since 1967; administrative control was handed over to the Palestinian Authority in 1994. It is known in Judeo-Christian tradition as the place of the Israelites\u2019 return from bondage in Egypt, led by Joshua, the successor to Moses. Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of more than 20 successive settlements in Jericho, the first of which dates back 11,000 years (9000 BCE), almost to the very beginning of the Holocene epoch of the Earth\u2019s history. [PAR] 2. Byblos, Lebanon [PAR] Founded as Gebal by the Phoenicians, Byblos was given its name by the Greeks, who imported papyrus from the city. It is a Mediterranean city in the Mount Lebanon Governorate of present-day Lebanon under the current Arabic name of Jubayl and was also referred to as Gibelet during the Crusades. It is believed to have been occupied first between 8800 and 7000 BC, and according to fragments attributed to the semi-legendary pre-Trojan war Phoenician historian Sanchuniathon, it was built by Cronus as the first city in Phoenicia. Today it is believed by many to be the oldest continuously-inhabited city in the world. [PAR] 3. Aleppo, Syria [PAR] Aleppo is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world; it has been inhabited since perhaps as early as the 6th millennium BC. Syria\u2019s most populated city with around 4.4 million citizens Aleppo was founded as Halab in around 4,300 BC. As the ancient site is occupied by the modern city it is barely touched by archaeologists. The city was under Hittite control until around 800 BC, before passing through Assyrian, Greek and Persian hands. It was later occupied by the Romans, Byzantines and Arabs, besieged by the Crusaders and then taken by the Mongols and Ottomans. [PAR] 4. Damascus, Syria [PAR] The capital and the second largest city of Syria after Aleppo, Damascus commonly known in Syria as ash-Sham and nicknamed as the City of Jasmine. Cited by some sources as the world\u2019s oldest inhabited city, Damascus may have been inhabited as early as 10,000 BC, also this is debated. It became an important settlement after the arrival of the Aramaeans, who established a network of canals, which still form the basis of its modern water networks. Another of Alexander the Great\u2019s conquests, Damascus has since been in Roman, Arab and Ottoman possession. Today, its wealth of historical attraction make it a popular tourist destination. [PAR] 5. Susa, Iran [PAR] Susa was an ancient city of the Elamite, Persian and Parthian empires of Iran. It is located in the lower Zagros Mountains about 250 km (160 mi) east of the Tigris River, between the Karkheh and Dez Rivers. In historic literature, Susa appears in the very earliest Sumerian records, e.g. in Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta it is described as one of the places obedient to Inanna, patron deity of Uruk. In urban history, Susa is one of the oldest-known settlements of the region and the world. Based on C14 dating the time of foundation of a settlement there is as early as 4395 BCE.

The amount of that acceleration depends on the body's inertia (or its tendency to resist changes in motion), which is measured as its mass. When Isaac Newton formulated Newtonian mechanics, he discovered three fundamental laws of motion. [PAR] Later, Albert Einstein proved that these laws are just a convenient approximation. These laws, however, greatly simplify calculations and are used when studying objects at velocities that are small compared with the speed of light. [PAR] Friction[ edit ] [PAR] It is the force that opposes relative motion or tendency of relative motion between two surfaces in contact represented by f. When two surfaces move relative to each other or they have a tendency to move relative to each other, at the point (or surface) of contact, there appears a force which opposes this relative motion or tendency of relative motion between two surfaces in contact. It acts on both the surfaces in contact with equal magnitude and opposite directions (Newton's 3rd law). Friction force tries to stop relative motion between two surfaces in contact, if it is there, and when two surfaces in contact are at rest relative to each other, the friction force tries to maintain this relative rest. Friction force can assume the magnitude (below a certain maximum magnitude called limiting static friction) required to maintain relative rest between two surfaces in contact. Because of this friction force is called a self adjusting force. [PAR] Earlier, it was believed that friction was caused due to the roughness of the two surfaces in contact with each other. However, modern theory stipulates that the cause of friction is the Coulombic force between the atoms present in the surface of the regions in contact with each other. [PAR] Formula: Limiting Friction = (Friction Coefficient)(Normal reaction) [PAR] Static Friction = the friction force that keeps an object at relative rest. [PAR] Kinetic Friction = sliding friction [PAR] Newton's First Law of Motion[ edit ] [PAR] (The Law of Inertia) [PAR] A static object with no net force acting on it remains at rest or if in movement it will maintain a constant velocity [PAR] This means, essentially, that acceleration does not occur without the presence of a force. The object tends to maintain its state of motion. If it is at rest, it remains at rest and if it is moving with a velocity then it keeps moving with the same velocity. This tendency of the object to maintain its state of motion is greater for larger mass. The \"mass\" is, therefore, a measure of the inertia of the object. [PAR] In a state of equilibrium, where the object is at rest or proceeding at a constant velocity, the net force in every direction must be equal to 0. [PAR] At a constant velocity (including zero velocity), the sum of forces is 0. If the sum of forces does not equal zero, the object will accelerate (change velocity over time). [PAR] It is important to note, that this law is applicable only in non-accelerated coordinate systems. It is so, because the perception of force in accelerated systems are different. A body under balanced force system in one frame of reference, for example a person standing in an accelerating lift, is acted upon by a net force in the earth's frame of reference. [PAR] Inertia is the tendency of an object to maintain its velocity i.e. to resist acceleration. [PAR] Inertia is not a force. [PAR] Inertia varies directly with mass.

The proclamation was the climax of years of battle between Mao\u2019s communist forces and the regime of Nationalist Chinese leader Chiang Kai-Shek, who had been supported with money and arms from the American government.  The loss of China, the largest nation in Asia, to communism was a severe blow to the United States, which was still reeling from the Soviet Union\u2019s detonation of a nuclear device one month earlier. [PAR] State Department officials in President Harry S. Truman\u2019s administration tried to prepare the American public for the worst when they released a \u201cwhite paper\u201d in August 1949.  The report argued that Chiang\u2019s regime was so corrupt, inefficient, and unpopular that no amount of U.S. aid could save it.  Nevertheless, the communist victory in China brought forth a wave of criticism from Republicans who charged that the Truman administration lost China through gross mishandling of the situation.  Other Republicans, notably Senator Joseph McCarthy, went further, claiming that the State Department had gone \u201csoft\u201d on communism; more recklessly, McCarthy suggested that there were procommunist sympathizers in the department. [PAR] The United States withheld recognition from the new communist government in China. The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, during which communist Chinese and U.S. forces did battle, drove an even deeper wedge between the two nations.  In the ensuing years, continued U.S. support of Chiang\u2019s Republic of China, which had been established on the island of Taiwan, and the refusal to seat the People\u2019s Republic of China at the United Nations made diplomatic relations impossible.

The heart valves in reality are not in this simplified orientation, but the diagram serves to show the valves and their relationship to each other. [PAR] The heart is generally thought of as having a right and left side. In reality, the heart is one organ and not divided into two separate organs. The heart is made up of four chambers, two on the right and two on the left. The chambers are known as atria and ventricles. Each side of the heart is composed of one atrium and one ventricle. The atria are the receiving chambers of the heart, receiving blood flowing back to the heart. The ventricles are the chambers of the heart that pump the blood out of the heart. [PAR] The valves of the heart are located within the chambers of the heart and are critical to the proper flow of blood through the heart. All of the valves, when functioning normally, act as one-way valves, allowing blood to flow either from one chamber to another, or allowing blood to flow out of the heart, in only one direction. The valves control the flow of blood through the heart by opening and closing during the contractions of the heart. The opening and closing functions of the valves are controlled by pressure differences generated within the heart, as well as some muscles located within the heart. [PAR] The four valves are known as: [PAR] The tricuspid valve[DOC] [TLE] An Overview of the Heart's Chambers and Valves - VerywellThe Heart's Chambers and Valves [PAR] The Heart's Chambers and Valves [PAR] Search the site [PAR] By Richard N. Fogoros, MD [PAR] Updated January 09, 2017 [PAR] The function of the heart is to pump the blood that bathes every organ of the body. The blood carries the oxygen and nutrients vital to the tissues\u00a0and removes waste products. If the pumping action of the heart is disrupted, the body's organs begin to fail very quickly. So life itself is dependent on the efficient, continuous operation of the heart. [PAR] The heart is a muscular organ roughly the size of your fist. [PAR] As the heart muscle contracts or squeezes, it propels the blood out into the vascular system. The heart's chambers and valves are arranged to direct the flow of the blood as the heart beats. [PAR] Heart\u2019s Chambers and Valves [PAR] The heart has four chambers. The two ventricles (right and left) are muscular chambers that propel the blood out of the heart. The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs, and the left ventricle pumps blood to all other organs. [PAR] The two atria (right and left) hold the blood returning to the heart, and at just the right moment empty into the right and left ventricles.\u00a0 [PAR] The\u00a0 four heart valves \u00a0(tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral and aortic) keep the blood moving in the right direction through the heart. [PAR] It is helpful to visualize the heart functioning as two separate pumps, working in series; the right heart pump, and the left heart pump.\u00a0 [PAR] The Right Heart Pump [PAR] The right heart pump consists of the right atrium, tricuspid valve, right ventricle, pulmonic valve, and pulmonary artery. [PAR] Its job is to make sure \u201cused\u201d blood gets reloaded with oxygen. Oxygen-poor blood returning to the heart from the body\u2019s tissues enters the right atrium. When the atria contract, the tricuspid valve opens and allows the blood to be pumped from the right atrium to the right ventricle. Then, when the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes (to prevent blood from washing backwards to the right atrium), and the pulmonic valve opens \u2014 so blood is ejected from the right ventricle and out to the pulmonary artery and the lungs, where it is replenished with oxygen.[DOC] [TLE] Chambers and Valves - How Your Heart Works | HowStuffWorksChambers and Valves - How Your Heart Works | HowStuffWorks\n\n\n### Answer:\nfour </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Normally people have three permanent molars that develop in each quadrant of the mouth; upper, lower, right and left. The first molars usually grow into the mouth at around six years of age. The second molars grow in at around age 12. The third molars usually will try to grow in at around age 17 to 21 years. Since that is considered to be the age when people become wiser, third molars gained the nickname, \"wisdom teeth.\" Actually, they are no different than any other tooth except that they are the last teeth to erupt, or grow into the mouth. They are just as useful as any other tooth if they grow in properly, have a proper bite relationship and have healthy gum tissue around them. Unfortunately, this does not always happen. [PAR] \u00a0[DOC] [TLE] Wisdom Teeth \u2013 Third Molars \u2013 Commonly Asked QuestionsWhat Are Wisdom Teeth? [PAR] By Shawn Watson - Reviewed by a board-certified physician. [PAR] Updated January 25, 2016 [PAR] Do you know someone who has had to have their wisdom teeth removed ? Have you had them removed yourself? Many individuals have to have their wisdom teeth removed at some point in their life, but why?\u00a0 [PAR] The Third Molars [PAR] The third molars , known simply as your wisdom teeth , are the last permanent teeth to erupt into your mouth. Wisdom teeth typically emerge between the ages of 17 and 21 years old. [PAR] Although the exact rationale behind the term \"wisdom teeth\" is unknown, it is thought that the third molars were given the name \"wisdom teeth\" because they erupt at a time when a child becomes wiser -- as they enter adulthood. [PAR] The average person will develop four wisdom teeth, but that is not always the case for all individuals. Many people develop supernumerary (extra) wisdom teeth , while some lucky individuals fail to develop some or all of their wisdom teeth altogether.\u00a0 [PAR] Typically, the average human mouth can only comfortably hold 28 of the 32 teeth that we are predisposed to have. Since the wisdom teeth are usually the last teeth to emerge, there is often little room or space left to accommodate their size and anatomy, which often causes the wisdom teeth to either: [PAR] Become impacted under the gum tissue and bone [PAR] Partially erupt into the mouth, resulting in only part of the tooth exposed above the gumline [PAR] Fully erupt into the mouth in an undesirable position -- usually tilting forward, pushing on the tooth in front of it. [PAR] Removal\u00a0 [PAR] The eruption of the wisdom teeth can be quite painful as they push through the gum. The positioning of wisdom teeth when they emerge can impact the positioning of other surrounding, already established teeth, which is why wisdom teeth are often removed . [PAR] It is quite possible that each one of your wisdom teeth will erupt differently from one another, for example you could have only one impacted wisdom tooth, and the rest could fully erupt. [PAR] During your regular dental check-up, your dentist may take a orthopantomogram x-ray, also known as a panorex , to diagnose whether or not your wisdom teeth need to be removed. [PAR] This x-ray gives the dentist a clear view of the area directly around the wisdom teeth, to determine the type of extraction necessary for each individual wisdom tooth. When the dentist discovers a reason for you to have your wisdom teeth removed he will access the position of the wisdom teeth and how each root is formed. Depending on his findings, your dentist will make the decision to preform the wisdom teeth extractions for you, or refer you to see an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon for your wisdom teeth extractions.

Insulin and glucagon are the hormones which make this happen. Both insulin and glucagon are secreted from the pancreas, and thus are referred to as pancreatic endocrine hormones. The picture on the left shows the intimate relationship both insulin and glucagon have to each other. Note that the pancreas serves as the central player in this scheme.\u00a0 It is the production of insulin and glucagon by the pancreas which ultimately determines if a patient has diabetes, hypoglycemia, or some other sugar problem. [PAR] In this Article [PAR] Insulin's Role in Blood Glucose Control [PAR] Insulin Basics: How Insulin Helps Control Blood Glucose Levels [PAR] Insulin and glucagon are hormones secreted by islet cells within the pancreas. They are both secreted in response to blood sugar levels, but in opposite fashion! [PAR] Insulin is normally secreted by the beta cells (a type of islet cell) of the pancreas. The stimulus for insulin secretion is a HIGH blood glucose...it's as simple as that!\u00a0 Although there is always a low level of insulin secreted by the pancreas, the amount secreted into the blood increases as the blood glucose rises. Similarly, as blood glucose falls, the amount of insulin secreted by the pancreatic islets goes down.\u00a0 [PAR] As can be seen in the picture, insulin has an effect on a number of cells, including muscle, red blood cells, and fat cells.\u00a0 In response to insulin, these cells absorb glucose out of the blood, having the net effect of lowering the high blood glucose levels into the normal range. [PAR] Glucagon is secreted by the alpha cells of the pancreatic islets in much the same manner as insulin...except in the opposite direction. If blood glucose is high, then no glucagon is secreted.\u00a0 [PAR] When blood glucose goes LOW, however, (such as between meals, and during exercise) more and more glucagon is secreted. Like insulin, glucagon has an effect on many cells of the body, but most notably the liver. [PAR] The Role of Glucagon in Blood Glucose Control [PAR] The effect of glucagon is to make the liver release the glucose it has stored in its cells into the bloodstream, with the net effect of increasing blood glucose. Glucagon also induces the liver (and some other cells such as muscle) to make glucose out of building blocks obtained from other nutrients found in the body (eg, protein). [PAR] Our bodies desire blood glucose to be maintained between 70 mg/dl and 110 mg/dl (mg/dl means milligrams of glucose in 100 milliliters of blood). Below 70 is termed \"hypoglycemia.\" Above 110 can be normal if you have eaten within 2 to 3 hours.\u00a0 That is why your doctor wants to measure your blood glucose while you are fasting...it should be between 70 and 110.\u00a0 Even after you have eaten, however, your glucose should be below 180. Above 180 is termed \"hyperglycemia\" (which translates to mean \"too much glucose in the blood\"). If your 2 two blood sugar measurements above 200 after drinking a sugar-water drink (glucose tolerance test), then you are diagnosed with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 [PAR] Updated on: 03/02/16[DOC] [TLE] Pancreas uses and ailments.

Credit: Richard Splivallo [PAR] Truffles, along with caviar, are among the most expensive foods in the world. Because they grow underground, people use trained dogs or pigs to find them. But the distinctive smell of truffles is not only of interest to gourmets. A group of German and French scientists under the direction of the Goethe University Frankfurt have discovered that the smell of white truffles is largely produced by soil bacteria which are trapped inside truffle fruiting bodies. [PAR] White truffles from the Piedmont region in Italy can reach 5,000 Euro per kilogram, and black truffles from the P\u00e9rigord region in Southern France as much as 2,000 Euro per kilogram. Particularly large specimens even fetch prices of up to 50,000 Euro per kilogram at auctions. Connoisseurs search for the precious delicacies near hazelnut trees, oaks and some species of pine. This is because truffles grow in a symbiotic relationship with the trees. For scientists truffles are therefore a model organism to investigate how symbiosis evolved between plants and fungi. [PAR] Truffles are also useful to study fungal smell and flavour. Understanding how flavours are created is indeed very important to the food industry. Yeasts and bacteria which make cheese and wine have been researched in depth, but little is known about how the flavour of other organisms, including truffles, is created. [PAR] Over the past 10 years, researchers already suspected that micro-organisms trapped inside truffle fruiting bodies contributed to the flavour. \"When the genome of the black Perigord truffle was mapped in 2010, we thought that the fungus had sufficient genes to create its flavour on its own\", junior professor Richard Splivallo from the Institute for Molecular Life Sciences at the Goethe University explained. [PAR] The team made up of German and French scientists studied the white truffle Tuber borchii. It is native to Europe but has been recently introduced in New Zealand and Argentina. The researchers were able to show that bacteria produce a specific class of volatile cyclic sulphur compounds, which make up part of the distinctive truffle smell. Dogs and pigs are able to find truffles underground thanks to the slightly sulphuric smell. [PAR] \"However, our results cannot be transferred to other types of truffles\", Splivallo says, \"because the compounds we investigated are only found in the white truffle Tuber borchii.\" For this reason, in the future they plan to study compounds which are found in the P\u00e9rigord and Piermont truffles and are common to all types of truffles. \"We don't just want to know which part of the truffle flavour is produced by bacteria. We are also interested in how the symbiosis between fungi and microorganisms has evolved and how this benefits both symbiotic partners.\" [PAR] Tuber uncinatum.

[PAR] His handsome physical appearance&emdash; very tall with broad shoulders, strong athletic limbs, and fair skin&emdash; added to his popularity. Throughout his reign King Henry VIII was married six different times. He married for both political and formal reasons. [PAR] Henry married his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, in June, 1509. Anne Boleyn became his second wife in secret in January, 1533. Jane Seymour, Henry's third wife, provided him the much desired heir to the throne in October, 1537. Henry married Anne of Cleves, his fourth wife, under political terms with Western Germany in 1540. Henry's fifth wife, Catherine Howard, was Anne of Cleves's maid of honor. She married Henry in 1540 also. Finally, Catherine Parr helped to bring his family together when they married in July, 1543. Catherine Parr outlived King Henry VIII when his glorious reign ended with his death on January 28, 1547. [PAR] Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon, was the widow of King Henry VIII's older brother, Arthur. Catherine was left widowed after a year of marriage when Arthur died in 1501. It was King Henry VII's dying wish for his son, Henry, to marry Catherine of Aragon. It was important for Henry to keep the alliance between England and Spain. Between the years 1510 and 1518, Catherine gave birth to six children, including two sons, but all except one daughter, Mary, were stillborn or died in early infancy. Catherine was unable to provide a male heir for King Henry VIII, which eventually led to the end of their marriage. Pope Clement VII refused to annul Henry's marriage to Catherine. Henry finally broke with the Roman Catholic church, and his new Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cromwell, had their marriage annulled. Soon after, Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, making the king head of the English church. Although Catherine was loved by the English people, she was forced to spend the last years of her life isolated from all public life. [PAR] Anne Boleyn was the second wife of King Henry VIII. They were privately married in January 1533, but the marriage did not become known until Easter of that year. Anne Boleyn was the mother of the future Queen Elizabeth I, born in September of 1533. During their marriage Henry quickly lost interest in Anne and began to have affairs with other women. All Anne had to do to save their marriage was provide a male heir for the King. After two attempts she failed. Committed to the Tower of London, Anne was charged with adultery and alleged to have been involved in several affairs. On May 19, 1536, she was convicted by a unanimous vote and beheaded. According to many historians, it is very likely that Anne was innocent, but she was declared guilty because of a temporary court faction supported by Thomas Cromwell.

[PAR] Estradiol, an important form of estrogen, can be measured to determine the quality of a woman\u2019s eggs \u2013 an important factor in fertility. [PAR] Luteinizing Hormone (LH) stimulates the release of eggs from the ovaries and prepares the uterus to receive a fertilized egg; LH levels can be measured to determine when ovulation will occur. [PAR] Progesterone is produced just after ovulation to finish preparing the uterus for the arrival of a fertilized egg. [PAR] Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) [PAR] Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) helps control a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle and egg production. During infertility testing, FSH is tested to determine a woman\u2019s ovarian function and evaluate the quality of her eggs. The test is done on day 2 to 5 of the menstrual cycle. As a woman\u2019s ovary function declines, the brain and pituitary gland increase the amount of FSH to stimulate the ovary to work \u201charder.\u201d Thus the FSH test is a very indirect indicator of the ovarian status. However, in a few years this test may be replaced by the AMH test and antral follicle count. [PAR] Determining the blood concentrations of FSH on day 3 of the menstrual cycle may estimate fertility potential. In general, women with elevated levels of FSH on cycle day 3 have reduced chances of live birth with both ovulation induction and in vitro fertilization (IVF) compared to other women of the same age. [PAR] Estradiol (see below) must be measured as well, as elevations of estradiol can be an early warning of low ovarian reserve. High estradiol will suppress the FSH, giving false reassurance of normal values. [PAR] The laboratory method of measuring these hormone levels may vary considerably, so it can be difficult to compare blood levels that are measured at different laboratories or by different techniques. In addition, it is important that normal and abnormal test values be based on the pregnancy rates achieved by women studied at a particular center using the same laboratory methods. [PAR] Estradiol [PAR] Estradiol, an important form of estrogen, is tested in conjunction with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to measure a woman\u2019s ovarian function and to evaluate the quality of the eggs. Like FSH, it is done during days 3 to 5 of a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle.The results of these tests are not absolute indicators of infertility but abnormal levels correlate with decreased response to ovulation induction medications and lowered IVF success. [PAR] Luteinizing hormone [PAR] Luteinizing Hormone (LH) stimulates the release of eggs from the ovaries and starts the production of progesterone, a hormone that transforms the uterine environment to receive a fertilized egg. LH shows up in the urine just prior to ovulation. To help women predict ovulation before it occurs, an over-the-counter test measures increases of LH in the urine. [PAR] Progesterone [PAR] Just after ovulation, the ovaries produce the progesterone hormone. At about 12 to 16 days into the menstrual month, progesterone prepares the uterus for the arrival of a fertilized egg. [PAR] Progesterone levels generally peak about a week after ovulation. A physician may perform blood tests to measure the progesterone directly in the blood stream.

[PAR] Pacemaker: A system that  sends electrical impulses to the heart in order to set the  heart rhythm. The pacemaker can be the normal \"natural\" pacemaker of the heart or it can be an electronic device. [PAR] The natural pacemaker of the heart is the sinus node , one of the major elements in the cardiac conduction system , the system that controls the heart rate . This stunningly designed system generates electrical impulses and conducts them throughout the muscle of the heart, stimulating the heart to contract and pump blood. [PAR] The sinus node consists of a cluster of cells that are situated in the upper part of the wall of the right atrium (the right upper chamber of the heart). The electrical impulses are generated there. The sinus node is also called the sinoatrial node or, for short, the SA node . [PAR] The electrical signal generated by the sinus node moves from cell to cell down through the heart until it reaches the atrioventricular node ( AV node ), a cluster of cells situated in the center of the heart between the atria and ventricles. The AV node serves as a gate that slows the electrical current before the signal is permitted to pass down through to the ventricles. This delay ensures that the atria have a chance to fully contract before the ventricles are stimulated. After passing the AV node, the electrical current travels to the ventricles along special fibers embedded in the walls of the lower part of the heart. [PAR] Although there are different types of artificial  pacemakers, all are designed to treat bradycardia , a heart  rate that is too slow. Some pacemakers function  continuously and stimulate the heart at a fixed rate or at  an increased rate during exercise. A pacemaker can also be  programmed to detect an overly long pause between  heartbeats, and then stimulate the heart. For more information, see Artificial pacemaker .

During his reign the royal domains were more than doubled, and the royal power was consolidated at the expense of the feudal lords. Philip defeated a coalition of Flanders, Burgundy, and Champagne (1181\u201386), securing Amiens, Artois, and part of Vermandois from the count of Flanders. He then attacked (1187) the English territories in France. Allied (Nov., 1188) with Richard, the rebellious son of King Henry II of England, Philip compelled Henry to cede several territories to him. After Henry's death (1189), Philip and Richard, now king of England (see Richard I ), left (1190) on the Third Crusade (see Crusades ). They soon quarreled, and after the capture of Acre (see Akko ) Philip returned (1191) to France. Richard also left the crusade but was captured on his way home by Leopold V of Austria. During Richard's captivity (1192\u201394), Philip conspired against him with Richard's brother John . After his release Richard made war (1194\u201399) on Philip, compelling him to surrender most of his annexations. When John acceded to the English throne on Richard's death (1199), Philip espoused the cause of Arthur I of Brittany and invaded John's French domains, forcing him to surrender (1204) Normandy, Brittany, Anjou, Maine, and Touraine. Philip later conquered Poitou. In 1214, at Bouvines, the French defeated the allied forces of John, Holy Roman Emperor Otto IV, and the count of Flanders; it was a victory that established France as a leading European power. When the English barons revolted against John (1215), they invited Philip's son Louis (later Louis VIII of France) to invade England and take the English throne; the venture failed. During Philip's reign the pope proclaimed the Crusade against the Albigenses . Although Philip did not participate directly in the crusade, he allowed his vassals to do so. Their victories prepared the ground for the annexation of S France by King Louis IX . In internal affairs Philip's most important reform was the creation of a class of salaried administrative officers, the baillis [bailiffs], to supervise local administration of the domain. Philip also systematized the collection of customs, tolls, fines, and fees due to the crown. He supported the towns of France against the royal barons, thereby increasing their power and prosperity. In Paris, he continued the construction of Notre-Dame de Paris , built the first Louvre , paved the main streets, and walled the city. [PAR] See biography by W. H. Hutton (1896, repr. 1970); J. W.

The relative rigidity of the cell wall renders plants sedentary, unlike animals, whose lack of this type of structure allows their cells more flexibility, which is necessary for locomotion.  The plant cell wall serves a variety of functions.  Along with protecting the intracellular contents, the structure bestows rigidity to the plant, provides a porous medium for the circulation and distribution of water, minerals, and other nutrients, and houses specialized molecules that regulate growth and protect the plant from disease. [PAR] Cell walls are significantly thicker than plasma membranes and were visible even to early microscopists, including Robert Hooke, who originally identified the structures in a sample of cork, and then coined the term cells in the 1660s.  The thickness, as well as the composition and organization, of cell walls can vary significantly.  Many plant cells have both a primary cell wall, which accommodates the cell as it grows, and a secondary cell wall they develop inside the primary wall after the cell has stopped growing.  The primary cell wall is thinner and more pliant than the secondary cell wall, and is sometimes retained in an unchanged or slightly modified state without the addition of the secondary wall, even after the growth process has ended. [PAR] The main chemical components of the primary plant cell wall include cellulose (in the form of organized microfibrils; see Figure 1), a complex carbohydrate made up of several thousand glucose molecules linked end to end.  In addition, the cell wall contains two groups of branched polysaccharides, the pectins and cross-linking glycans.  Organized into a network with the cellulose microfibrils, the cross-linking glycans increase the tensile strength of the cellulose, whereas the coextensive network of pectins provides the cell wall with the ability to resist compression.  In addition to these networks, a small amount of protein can be found in all plant primary cell walls.  Some of this protein is thought to increase mechanical strength and part of it consists of enzymes, which initiate reactions that form, remodel, or breakdown the structural networks of the wall.  Such changes in the cell wall directed by enzymes are particularly important for fruit to ripen and leaves to fall in autumn. [PAR] The secondary plant cell wall, which is often deposited inside the primary cell wall as a cell matures, sometimes has a composition nearly identical to that of the earlier-developed wall.  More commonly, however, additional substances, especially lignin, are found in the secondary wall.  Lignin is the general name for a group of polymers of aromatic alcohols that are hard and impart considerable strength to the structure of the secondary wall.  Lignin is what provides the favorable characteristics of wood to the fiber cells of woody tissues and is also common in the secondary walls of xylem vessels, which are central in providing structural support to plants.  Lignin also makes plant cell walls less vulnerable to attack by fungi or bacteria, as do cutin, suberin, and other waxy materials that are sometimes found in plant cell walls. [PAR] A specialized region associated with the cell walls of plants, and sometimes considered an additional component of them, is the middle lamella (see Figure 1).  Rich in pectins, the middle lamella is shared by neighboring cells and cements them firmly together.  Positioned in such a manner, cells are able to communicate with one another and share their contents through special conduits.  Termed plasmodesmata, these small passages penetrate the middle lamella as well as the primary and secondary cell walls, providing pathways for transporting cytoplasmic molecules from one cell to another.[DOC] [TLE] Characteristics of Cell Walls | eHowCharacteristics of Cell Walls | eHow [PAR] Characteristics of Cell Walls [PAR] \ue076 Email [PAR] Save [PAR] A cell wall is an additional layer found in specific organism's cells.

In many cases, broken pieces of glass called cullet are also added to these raw materials to help them properly melt when heated. [PAR] Full Answer [PAR] There are a number of different ways to make glass, depending on the desired finished product. No matter what type of glass is being made, the process begins with slowly heating all of the raw materials in a furnace to approximately 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit until they melt. The melted materials are then rapidly heated to a temperature of 2,800 degrees to allow the raw materials to fully mix together. [PAR] At that point, sheet or plate glass is made by allowing the melted raw materials to flow out of the furnace and onto a bed of molten tin. From there, the melted glass is left to slowly cool on the molten tin, which changes the structure of the glass to make it much stronger and to enable it to be cut. [PAR] The molten glass can also be formed in other ways, such as by blowing air into the glass, which is often used to make cups, beads and other types of glass ware.[DOC] [TLE] Raw Materials Used to Make Glass - Bryson >Glass [PAR] Glass [PAR] You don't have Adobe Flash installed!

In the past it was very expensive and  only the richest people could afford glass for windows and jewellery. Today  glass is much less expensive and is used to make many different things, from  windows and light bulbs to milk bottles and glass jars. [PAR] Glass  is transparent, hard, is easily moulded into shapes and does not flavour food  or drink stored in it. This makes it ideal for making bottles and jars. [PAR] The  main raw material used to make glass is sand. To make clear glass, a special  sand called silica sand is used. [PAR] This  fine white sand is needed because it is very pure and does not contain other  unwanted chemicals. Glass production also needs limestone, soda ash and other  chemicals to colour the glass. The production of glass uses energy, both during  the extraction of the sand as well as during transportation and processing.  Large amounts of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) are used during these stages,  which in turn produce the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. [PAR] The  main sources of the silica sand needed to make clear glass are in Australia and South East Asia in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia  and Vietnam.  Silica sand also comes from other countries including China, India  and Egypt.  Some sand is from Britain  and Ireland and most of the  glass factories in the U.K.  use this sand. [PAR] There are different types of glass  and each uses a slightly different mix of raw materials. The sand, limestone  and other ingredients are carefully weighted and melted together in a furnace  at around 1500\u00ba C (water boils at 100\u00ba C). The molten glass is then formed into  the final product, for example sheets for windows or shaped into bottles and  jars. [PAR] If you  have a recycling bin, you cannot put glass bottles and jars in it. This is  because the glass would smash in the lorries and get mixed with the other  materials. [PAR] People  who have Kerbie recycling boxes can use them to recycle their glass bottles and  jars. Glass can also be recycled in bottle banks at Recycling Centres and some  supermarket car parks. Make sure the bottles and jars are empty and give them a  rinse out. Your local Council will be able to tell you exactly where your  nearest bottle banks are.

Nitrate, both during spring runoff and during growing seasons, declined from 1983 through 1995. Declining snowmelt nitrate was caused primarily by changes in snow regime induced by the 1987-1992 drought: years with shallow, early melting snowpacks had lower snowmelt nitrate concentrations owing to less labile N production in catchment soils and longer plant growing seasons. However, nitrate declines during growing seasons carried through the wetter years of 1993-2000 and are likely the result of increased P loading to the lake and the release of phytoplankton from P limitation. Contemporaneous with these changes was an increase in algal biomass and a shift from P limitation toward more frequent N limitation of phytoplankton abundance. Particulate carbon concentrations in the late 1990s were two- to threefold greater than in the early 1980s. These trends were reflected in a larger set of Sierra Nevada lakes sampled as part of synoptic surveys (n = 28). Between 1985 and 1999, nitrate decreased and total P increased in >70% of the lakes sampled. Our data suggest that lakes throughout the Sierra Nevada are experiencing measurable eutrophication in response to the atmospheric deposition of nutrients.

In fact,                concentrations of phosphorus exceeded the USEPA desired goal for                phosphorus for preventing nuisance plant growth in streams (0.1                parts per million) in about 75 percent of agricultural and urban                streams sampled by the NAWQA Program. It is difficult and premature,                however, to attempt a national summary of the effects of eutrophication                because methodologies are limited for deriving criteria based only                on nutrient concentrations. In recognition of these limitations,                USEPA, in collaboration with USGS and other federal agencies, and                state agencies, is developing a strategy to evaluate aquatic plant                growth and to develop an understanding of stream nutrient dynamics,                stream habitat (including shading and temperature), turbidity, and                algal-growth processes.

Snowdon [PAR] [while President of the Animal Behavior Society] [PAR] Animal behavior is the bridge between the molecular and physiological aspects of biology and the ecological. Behavior is the link between organisms and environment and between the nervous system, and the ecosystem. Behavior is one of the most important properties of animal life. Behavior plays a critical role in biological adaptations. Behavior is how we humans define our own lives. Behavior is that part of an organism by which it interacts with its environment. Behavior is as much a part of an organisms as its coat, wings etc. The beauty of an animal includes its behavioral attributes. [PAR] For the same reasons that we study the universe and subatomic particles there is intrinsic interest in the study of animals. In view of the amount of time that television devotes to animal films and the amount of money that people spend on nature books there is much more public interest in animal behavior than in neutrons and neurons. If human curiosity drives research, then animal behavior should be near the top of our priorities. [PAR] Research on animal behavior and behavioral ecology has been burgeoning in recent years despite below inflation increases (and often decreases) in research funding. Two of our journals Animal Behaviour and Behavior Ecology and Sociobiology rank in the top six behavioral science AND zoological journals in terms of impact as measured by the Science Citation Index. From 1985 to 1990 Animal Behaviour has grown from quarterly to monthly publication and its page budget has more than doubled. Many related journals have increased their size and frequency of publication in the same period. Ours is an active and vital field. [PAR] While the study of animal behavior is important as a scientific field on its own, our science has made important contributions to other disciplines with applications to the study of human behavior, to the neurosciences, to the environment and resource management, to the study of animal welfare and to the education of future generations of scientists. [PAR] A.  ANIMAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN SOCIETY [PAR] Many problems in human society are often related to the interaction of environment and behavior or genetics and behavior. The fields of socioecology and animal behavior deal with the issue of environment behavioral interactions both at an evolutionary level and a proximate level. Increasingly social scientists are turning to animal behavior as a framework in which to interpret human society and to understand possible causes of societal problems. (e.g. Daly and Wilson's book on human homicide is based on an evolutionary analysis from animal research. Many studies on child abuse utilize theory and data from studies on infanticide in animals.) [PAR] Research by de Waal on chimpanzees and monkeys has illustrated the importance of cooperation and reconciliation in social groups. This work provides new perspectives by which to view and ameliorate aggressive behavior among human beings. [PAR] The methodology applied to study animal behavior has had a tremendous impact in psychology and the social sciences. Jean Piaget began his career with the study of snails, and he extended the use of careful behavioral observations and descriptions to his landmark studies on human cognitive development. J. B. Watson began his study of behavior by observing gulls. Aspects of experimental design, observation techniques, attention to nonverbal communication signals were often developed in animal behavior studies before their application to studies of human behavior. The behavioral study of humans would be much diminished today without the influence of animal research. [PAR] Charles Darwin's work on emotional expression in animals has had an important influence on many psychologists, such as Paul Ekman, who study human emotional behavior. [PAR] Harry Harlow's work on social development in rhesus monkeys has been of major importance to theories of child development and to psychiatry. The work of Overmier, Maier and Seligman on learned helplessness has had a similar effect on child development and psychiatry. [PAR] The comparative study of behavior over a wide range of species can provide insights into influences affecting human behavior. For example, the woolly spider monkey in Brazil displays no overt aggressive behavior among group members. We might learn how to minimize human aggression if we understood how this species of monkey avoids aggression.

[PAR] Question: What Is the Most Abundant Gas in the Earth's Atmosphere? [PAR] The Earth's atmosphere or air is composed of several gases. One gas is much more abundant than any other. Can you guess which one it is? [PAR] Answer:\u00a0By far, the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere is nitrogen , which accounts for about 78% of the mass of dry air. Oxygen is the next most abundant gas, present at levels of 20-21%. Although humid air seems like it contains a lot of water, the maximum amount of water vapor that air can hold is only about 4%. [PAR] Abundance of Gases in the Atmosphere [PAR] This table lists the eleven most abundant gases in the lower portion of Earth's atmosphere (up to 25 km). While the percentage of nitrogen and oxygen are fairly stable, the amount of greenhouse gases changes and depends on location. Water vapor is extremely variable. In arid or extremely cold regions, water vapor may be nearly absent. In warm, tropical regions, water vapor accounts for a significant portion of atmospheric gases. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Test Your General Science Knowledge [PAR] Some references include other gases on this list, such as krypton (less abundant than helium, but more than hydrogen), xenon (less abundant than hydrogen), nitrogen dioxide (less abundant than ozone), and iodine (less abundant than ozone). [PAR] Gas [PAR] * gases with variable composition [PAR] Reference:\u00a0Pidwirny, M. (2006). \"Atmospheric Composition\".\u00a0Fundamentals of Physical Geography, 2nd Edition. [PAR] The average concentration of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxde, methane, and nitrous dioxide has been increasing. Ozone is concentrated around cities and in the Earth's stratosphere. In addition to the elements in the table and krypton, xenon, nitrogen dioxide, and iodine (all mentioned earlier), there are trace amounts of ammonia, carbon monoxide, and several other gases. [PAR] Why Is Important To Know the Abundance of Gases? [PAR] It's important to know which gas is most abundant, what the other gases are in the Earth's atmosphere, and how the composition of air changes with altitude and over time for multiple reasons. The information helps us understand and predict the weather. The amount of water vapor in air is particularly relevant to weather forecasting. The gas composition helps us understand the effects of natural and manmade chemicals released into the atmosphere. The make-up of the atmosphere is extremely important for climate, so changes in gases may help us predict broad climate change.[DOC] [TLE] What Are the Three Most Abundant Gases in the Earth's ...What Are the Three Most Abundant Gases in the Earth's Atmosphere? | Sciencing [PAR] What Are the Three Most Abundant Gases in the Earth's Atmosphere? [PAR] By Patricia Arnett [PAR] Ablestock.com/AbleStock.com/Getty Images [PAR] The atmosphere is a mixture of gases that surround the Earth. It is essential to all life and serves several purposes, such as providing air for respiration, absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, protecting the earth from falling meteorites, controlling climate and regulating the water cycle.

There are estimated to be only 140,000 red squirrels left in Britain, with over 2.5 million greys. The Forestry Commission is working with partners in projects across Britain to develop a long-term conservation strategy that deters greys and encourages reds. [PAR] Name [PAR] Lifestyle [PAR] Habitat [PAR] Red squirrels build large nests, called dreys, often in the forks of tree trunks. They are usually solitary, only coming together to mate. But they do not mind social interactions and related squirrels will share dreys to keep warm during cold winter months. Reds range widely, especially when looking for mates. [PAR] Breeding [PAR] Red squirrels produce young, called kittens in the spring and can reproduce a second time in the summer if conditions are right. Watch for courtship displays in the trees. Females usually have 2-3 kittens but litters can be of up to 6 young, born 45-48 days after mating. Females bring up the young and are territorial over their brood. [PAR] Development [PAR] Between 20 and 50 per cent of kittens survive to adulthood. Young red squirrels are weaned off their mother's milk after about 8 - 12 weeks, when they have developed a complete set of teeth. [PAR] Diet [PAR] Red squirrels are seed eaters. They favour pine cones, but also eat larch and spruce. Their diet also includes fungi, shoots and fruits of shrubs and trees, and sometimes birds' eggs. They can choose between good and bad nuts by holding them in their paws. Reds do not hibernate and store fungi in trees to eat over the winter months. When food is plentiful, they put on weight in the autumn to help them through the winter. This is important for breeding females, so that they are in good condition for producing young. [PAR] Threats [PAR] The main threats to the survival of the reds are the increasing number of grey squirrels, disease (squirrel poxvirus) and road traffic. Greys can feed more efficiently in broadleaved woodlands and can survive at densities of up to 8 per hectare. The density of reds is up to 1 per hectare in broadleaved woodland but can be as low as 0.1 per hectare in coniferous woodland. [PAR] The main predators of red squirrels are birds of prey, such as goshawks and pine marten. In some urban areas, such as Jersey, domestic cats are also a threat when squirrels go into gardens to feed. [PAR] Identification [PAR] Red squirrels usually have russet red fur, although coat colour can vary with some reds appearing very grey (and some grey squirrels can have red fur down their backs and on their feet). They are small with ear tuffs - large tuffs in winter - while grey squirrels are stockier and rounder. There is little difference between males and females, which makes it difficult to distinguish between the sexes. [PAR] Red squirrels are very elusive and spend much of their time in the tree canopy. Telltale signs to look for include large dreys in trees, scratch marks on bark, and chewed pine cones that look like chewed apple cores. The 'chuk chuk' noise is a vocalisation used often not just when frightened and the foot tapping - perhaps better to say when agitated as they do it when angry or not happy - if they are frightened they've probably disappeared by then. [PAR] How we manage our woods [PAR] The survival of the red squirrel may depend on the design and management of conifer forest, their preferred habitat.

[PAR] Article Updated: 12 Jul , 2016 [PAR] by Matt Williams [PAR] Video [PAR] When you look up at the night sky, assuming conditions are just right, you might just catch a glimpse of a faint, white band reaching across the heavens. This band, upon closer observation, looks speckled and dusty, filled with a million tiny points of light and halos of glowing matter. What you are seeing is the Milky Way, something that astronomers and stargazers alike have been staring up at since the beginning of time. [PAR] But just what is the Milky Way? Well, simply put, it is the name of the barred spiral galaxy in which our solar system is located. The Earth orbits the Sun in the Solar System, and the Solar System is embedded within this vast galaxy of stars. It is just one of hundreds of billions of galaxies in the Universe, and ours is called the Milky Way because the disk of the galaxy appears to be spanning the night sky like a hazy band of glowing white light. [PAR] Discovery and Naming: [PAR] Our galaxy was named because of the way the haze it casts in the night sky resembled spilled milk. This name is also quite ancient. It is translation from the Latin \u201cVia Lactea\u201c, which in turn was translated from the Greek for Galaxias, referring to the pale band of light formed by stars in the galactic plane as seen from Earth. [PAR] Persian astronomer Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201\u20131274) even spelled it out in his book Tadhkira: \u201cThe Milky Way, i.e. the Galaxy, is made up of a very large number of small, tightly clustered stars, which, on account of their concentration and smallness, seem to be cloudy patches. Because of this, it was likened to milk in color.\u201d [PAR] Artist\u2019s impression of the Milky Way Galaxy, as seen from above the galactic \u201cNorth pole\u201d. Credit: NASA [PAR] Astronomers had long suspected the Milky Way was made up of stars, but it wasn\u2019t proven until 1610, when Galileo Galilei turned his rudimentary telescope towards the heavens and resolved individual stars in the band across the sky. With the help of telescopes, astronomers realized that there were many, many more stars in the sky, and that all of the ones that we can see are a part of the Milky Way. [PAR] In 1755, Immanuel Kant proposed that the Milky Way was a large collection of stars held together by mutual gravity. Just like the Solar System, this collection of stars would be rotating and flattened out as a disk, with the Solar System embedded within it. Astronomer William Herschel (who discovered Uranus) attempted to actually map out the shape of the Milky Way in 1785, but he didn\u2019t realize that large portions of the galaxy are obscured by gas and dust, which hide sits true shape. [PAR] It wasn\u2019t until the 1920s, when Edwin Hubble provided conclusive evidence that the spiral nebulae in the sky were actually whole other galaxies, that the true shape of our galaxy was known. Thenceforth, astronomers came to understand that the Milky Way is a barred, spiral galaxy, and also came to appreciate how big the Universe truly is. [PAR] Structure and Composition: [PAR] The Milky Way looks brightest toward the galactic center, in the direction of Sagittarius. The fact that the Milky Way divides the night sky into two roughly equal hemispheres indicates that the Solar System lies near the galactic plane. The Milky Way has a relatively low surface brightness due to the gases and dust that fills the galactic disk. That prevents us from seeing the bright galactic center or from observing clearly what is on the other side of it.

It was named after a mythical sea god who could change his shape at will. Proteus was discovered in 1989 by the Voyager 2 spacecraft. It is irregular in shape and is probably about as large as an irregular body can be before gravity pulls it into a spherical shape. Like Saturn's moon, Phoebe, Proteus is extremely dark in color. It reflects only 6% of the sunlight that strikes it. Proteus is larger than Nereid, but was discovered much later because it is so dark and so close to Neptune that it is difficult to spot in the planet's bright glare. Its surface is heavily cratered, and shows no signs of geologic activity. [PAR] Voyager 2 Image of Proteus [PAR] (NASA / JPL) [PAR] 20.3 [PAR] Nereid [PAR] Nereid [NEER-ee-ed] is the eighth and outermost of Neptune's moons and is the third largest. It was named after the sea nymphs who were the daughters of Nereus and Doris. Nereid was discovered by Gerard Kuiper in 1949. It reflects about 14% of the sunlight that strikes it. This makes it a little brighter than Earth's moon and more than twice as reflective than Proteus. Nereid is famous for having the most eccentric orbit of any moon in the Solar System. Its distance from Neptune ranges from 841,100 miles (1,353,600 km) to 5,980,200 miles (9,623,700 km).

Battlefields       were often miles from medical tents. An injured soldier could die on his       to treatment         if he had to be carried by men on foot. Although we may think of       ambulances in terms of automobiles, earlier forms of ambulances were used       as long ago as the middle ages, when men wounded in battle during the       Crusades (a series of eight extended battles fought by European noblemen       from 1095-1291 to protect the Christian Byzantine empire from Muslim       Turks) were transported by horse-drawn wagons to centralized treatment       centers. [PAR] Father of the Modern Ambulance [PAR] The modern ambulance\u2014at least the horse-driven version\u2014was       cre-ated by Frenchman Dominique-Jean Larrey (1766-1842) in 1792. Larrey, Napoleon's private surgeon, wanted to       improve battlefield treatment of wounded soldiers. He designed a       horse-drawn \"flying ambulance\" to carry surgeons and medical       supplies onto the field of battle during the Rhine campaign of 1792. [PAR] For the Italian campaign of 1794, Larrey used light ambulance carriages       with stretchers to carry the wounded. In Egypt in 1799, local camels       powered Larrey's ambulances. With fellow surgeon Pierre Percy       (1754-1825), Larrey formed a battalion of ambulance soldiers, including       stretcher bearers and surgeons. Larrey's ambulances and the swift       medical attention they brought significantly boosted the morale of       Napoleon's troops. [PAR] Ambulance service was expanded from the military to the civilian world in       1869 by Bellevue Hospital in New York City. The Larrey \"flying       ambulance\" remained standard until the first motorized ambulances       appeared around the turn of the century. These motorized vehicles were       pioneered by the Panhard-Levassor partnership of France. [PAR] A modern ambulance speeds off in response to an emergency call. [PAR] Air and Ground Ambulances [PAR] The first airborne ambulances were hot-air balloons used to evacuate       wounded personnel from Paris during a Prussian siege in 1870. Heli-copters       began to transport wounded soldiers during World War II (1939-1945) and       became vital evacuation vehicles in the Korean (1950-1953) and Vietnam       (1965-1973) wars. Today, air ambulances\u2014both fixed-wing and       helicopters\u2014are increasingly used for quick transportation of       patients, particularly in busy cities, but also in rural areas where       medical care may be a great distance from the scene of an accident. [PAR] Until the mid-1960s, ambulances were mostly modified hearses, since these       vehicles could transport patients in a supine (lying down on one's       back) position. Since hearses were designed to carry corpses instead of       living patients needing care, they had little room for supplies or       attendants, let alone treatment en route to the hospital. A National       Academy of Science/National Research Council report in 1966 focused       attention on the need for both professional training of emergency medical       technicians (EMTs) and improvements in ambulance design. This report       resulted in today's modern van ambulance, with it's working       space and sophisticated supplies and equipment. The van ambulance is       operated by medical para-professionals, so that the ambulance is no longer       simply a transportation vehicle\u2014it is also a moving treatment       center.

No, she wasn't handing out free cars or trips to Australia, just high fives and heaps of positivity.

Aristotle was perhaps the first person who wrote on ornithology and mentions more than 170 birds. The earliest known use of the word Ornithology seems to be in the third edition of Blotints Glossographia (1670). John Ray (I628-1705) wrote the path-breaking Ornithologia in 1676 and the Synopsis Methodica Avium in 1713. Carolus Linnaeus (1758) was the pioneer in developing a classification system for birds and animals. He proposed the classification of animals into groups that had things in common. His scientific classification system, with some modification is still being used. [PAR] The science of Ornithology includes the study of classification of birds , evolution , body structure, habits, song, flight and breeding behavior. Birds are generally divided into two major groups. Ostriches, Emus, and Kiwis are ratites, flightless birds that lack keel-like extension on the breast bone. The vast majority of the birds, however, are non-ratites and possess the keel to which the powerful muscles that power the wings are attached. There are over 9200 extant species of birds divided into 30 orders & 174 families. Their ability to fly has allowed them to colonize every land mass on earth including the Arctic and Antarctic and some, like the Penguins have adapted an aquatic lifestyle coming to shore only to breed and raise young. Fossil evidence of the ancestors of modern birds indicates that they were contemporaneous with dinosaurs. [PAR] Classifying Bird Species: [PAR] The scientific name of a species has two parts. The first name describes the Genus and the second describes the bird specie. The second name may also be a person's name -- often the name of the ornithologist that first discovered the bird. This naming system is called the Binomial nomenclature and a more modern Trinomial nomenclature is now being used in which the third name describes the sub-species. [PAR] There is some evidence to suggest that these feathered creatures are in fact the highly evolved living incarnation of the reptiles (see: The Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection by Charles Darwin). This long evolutionary history has allowed for the development of the many unique morphological, physical and behavioral attributes in birds that make the science of ornithology such an interesting vocation. [PAR] As scientists learn more about birds, they are able to arrange the 10,000+ species of birds into the correct Order, Family and Genus. There is a surprising amount of debate about some birds. Are they really a species or not? They may actually be a race of a similar species in the same genus. Combining two apparent species into just one new species is called \"lumping\". Separating a species into two or more species is called \"splitting\". This \"splitting\" and 'lumping' of species is becoming more frequent today as DNA research is used. [PAR] Scientific classification is undergoing a big change. Dr. Charles G. Sibley did research for over twenty years using DNA from bird's blood. He and his associates suggested a new way to classify the birds of the world. His system is called the Sibley/Ahlquist/Monroe classification . Dr. Sibley discovered that some species are more closely related than thought earlier. He also rearranged Orders and Families in an unexpected new way. Additional research being done today is proving that Dr. Sibley is probably right. The SAM classification seems, to many scientists, to be better than the one used for the last 100 years. Scientists want to be very sure this new system is better than the traditional classification before they make an official change. [PAR] Dr Salim Ali (1896 - 1987) was India's most well-known Ornithologist and bird watcher. Today there are many scientists or ornithologists investigating birds. It is certain that their work will make bird species appear and disappear as they continue lumping and splitting. That is why a computerized list of the world's birds makes more sense\n\n\n### Answer:\nornithology </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Through photosynthesis , plants     convert energy from sunlight into food stored as carbohydrates. Because     animals cannot get energy directly from the sun, they must eat plants (or     other animals that have had a vegetarian meal) to survive. Plants also     provide the oxygen humans and animals breathe, because plants use carbon     dioxide for photosynthesis and release oxygen into the atmosphere. [PAR] Plants are found on land, in oceans, and in fresh water. They have been     on Earth for millions of years. Plants were on Earth before animals and     currently number about 260,000 species. Three features distinguish plants     from animals: [PAR] Plants have chlorophyll , a green       pigment necessary for photosynthesis; [PAR] Their cell walls are made sturdy by a material called cellulose ; and [PAR] They are fixed in one place (they don\u2019t move). [PAR] Plant Classification [PAR] In order to study the billions of different organisms living on earth,     biologists have sorted and classified them based on their similarities and     differences. This system of classification is also     called a taxonomy and usually     features both English and Latin names for the different divisions. [PAR] All plants are included in one so-called kingdom (Kingdom Plantae), which is then broken down into smaller and smaller     divisions based on several characteristics, including: [PAR] Whether they can circulate fluids (like rainwater) through their       bodies or need to absorb them from the moisture that surrounds       them; [PAR] How they reproduce (e.g., by spores or different kinds       of seeds); and [PAR] Their size or stature. [PAR] The majority of the 260,000 plant species are flowering herbs. To     describe all plant species, the following divisions (or phyla) are most     commonly used to sort them. The first grouping is made up of plants that     are non-vascular; they cannot circulate rainwater through their stems and     leaves but must absorb it from the environment that surrounds them. The     remaining plant species are all vascular (they have a     system for circulating fluids). This larger group is then split into two     groups: one that reproduces from spores rather than seeds, and the other     that reproduces from seeds. [PAR] Non-Vascular Plants [PAR] Mosses and \u201callies,\u201d or related species (Bryophyta and     allies) [PAR] Mosses or bryophyta are non-vascular. They are an important     foundation plant for the forest ecosystem and they help prevent erosion by     carpeting the forest floor. All bryophyte species reproduce by spores not     seeds, never have flowers, and are found growing on the ground, on rocks,     and on other plants. [PAR] Originally grouped as a single division or phylum, the 24,000     bryophyte species are now grouped in three divisions: Mosses (Bryophyta), Liverworts (Hepatophyta), and Hornworts (Anthocerotophyta). Also included among the non-vascular plants     is Chlorophyta , a kind of fresh-water algae. [PAR] Vascular Plants with Spores [PAR] Ferns and allies (Pteridophyta and allies) [PAR] Unlike mosses, ferns and related species have a vascular system, but     like mosses, they reproduce from spores rather than seeds. The ferns are     the most plentiful plant division in this group, with 12,000 species.     Other divisions (the fern allies) include Club mosses or Lycopods     (Lycopodiophyta) with 1,000 species, Horsetails (Equisetophyta)     with 40 species, and Whisk ferns (Psilophyta) with 3 species. [PAR] Vascular Plants with Seeds [PAR] Conifers and allies (Coniferophyta and allies) [PAR] Conifers and allies     (Coniferophyta and allies) Conifers reproduce from seeds, but     unlike plants like blueberry bushes or flowers where the fruit or flower     surrounds the seed, conifer seeds (usually cones) are \u201cnaked.\u201d In addition to having cones , conifers are trees     or shrubs that never have flowers and that have needle-like leaves.

There, Jennifer Jones was awarded Best Actress honors for The Song of Bernadette, which also won for Best Film, while Paul Lukas took home Best Actor laurels for Watch on the Rhine. Awards were presented in the form of scrolls. [PAR] The following year, the members of the association held a contest to find a design for a statuette that would best represent the overall aims of the organization.

Going My Way won for Best Picture, while Ingrid Bergman and Alexander Knox were named Best Actress and Best Actor for their performances in The Bells of St. Mary and President Wilson, respectively. [PAR] There have been other important landmarks in the history of the Golden Globes. In 1951 the association decided to divide the best film, actor and actress nominees into two categories -- drama, and musical or comedy -- so that no genre would be slighted.

(with pictures) - wiseGEEKWhat is Plaster of Paris? (with pictures) [PAR] What is Plaster of Paris? [PAR] Last Modified Date: 27 November 2016 [PAR] Copyright Protected: [PAR] These 10 facts about space will blow your mind [PAR] Plaster of Paris is a type of plaster which can be used in art, architecture, fireproofing, and medical applications. When people think of \u201cplaster,\u201d they are often thinking specifically of plaster of Paris, although there are a number of different types of plaster on the market including lime plaster and cement plaster. Many art and construction supply stores sell plaster of Paris, and it can also be ordered through specialty companies. [PAR] This plaster is made by calcining gypsum , a process which involves exposing the gypsum to very high temperatures to create calcium sulfate and then grinding it into a fine white powder. When water is added to the powder to make a slurry, the slurry can be molded in a variety of ways, and as it sets, a firm matrix is created, creating a solid shape which is also very smooth. One advantage to plaster of Paris is that there is no volume loss, so casts made with this plaster are true to the size of the mold. [PAR] History seems to indicate that, despite the name, plaster of Paris was invented by the Egyptians. It was used as an artistic decoration in many Egyptian tombs, and the Greeks picked up the technique, using plaster in their own homes, temples, and works of art. Paris became synonymous with this type of plaster in the 1600s, thanks to a large deposit of gypsum which made it easy to produce plaster of Paris. The substance was also used extensively in fireproofing, giving Parisian homes a distinctive appearance. [PAR] In art, plaster of Paris can be used to make sculptures, and test molds for bronze and other metal castings. Plaster can also be used to make molds which will be very dependable while withstanding high temperatures. Plaster can also be used as an architectural feature, as for example in the case of plaster moldings mounted on doorways and window frames. [PAR] As a building material, plaster of Paris can be used to increase the fire resistance of a structure. It is often applied as a coating over other construction materials like metal and wood. Doctors have historically used plaster of Paris to make smooth, hard casts for broken limbs. This material can also be utilized in criminal investigations, with plaster of Paris being used to make molds of footprints, tire treads, and other markings. Because the plaster will not shrink as it dries, it can be used to create a court-admissible cast as well as a reference which can be used in an investigation.

[PAR] By Christopher Crockett in Space | November 8, 2012 [PAR] Black holes are the remnants of very massive stars with gravity so strong that not even light can escape. [PAR] Black holes may be among the strangest \u2013 and most commonly misunderstood \u2013 objects in our universe. The remnants of the most massive stars, they sit at the limit of our understanding of physics. They can contain several times the mass of our sun in a space no larger than a city.  With gravity so intense that not even light can escape their surfaces, black holes can teach us about the absolute extremes in the cosmos and the very structure of space itself. [PAR] Artist\u2019s rendition of a black hole drawing gas off a nearby star. Credit: NASA E/PO, Sonoma State University, Aurore Simonnet [PAR] Conceptually, black holes aren\u2019t all that complicated. They are nothing more than extremely dense cores of once-massive stars. Most stars, like our sun, end their lives peacefully by gently blowing their outer layers into space. But stars exceeding about eight times the mass of the sun take another, more dramatic, path. [PAR] These stars die when they can no longer fuse atomic nuclei in their core. It\u2019s not that they run out of fuel, per se. Rather, once the star has a core of iron, fusing together atoms to make new elements actually costs the star energy. Lacking an energy source, the star can\u2019t hold itself up against the relentless struggle with gravity. The outer layers of the star come crashing down. [PAR] As several octillion tons of gas come hurdling down, the star\u2019s core undergoes a drastic change and becomes resilient to further compression. The infalling gas hits the now-hardened core and rebounds. The rapid gas compression sets off one last wave of uncontrolled nuclear fusion. The star, now wildly out of balance, explodes. The resulting supernova can outshine an entire galaxy and can be seen from across the universe. [PAR] A supernova remnant, N49, located 160,000 light-years away in the Large Magellenic Cloud\u2014a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. At roughly 5000 years old, the supernova most likely left behind a compact neutron star in its wake. This composite image shows x-rays (purple), infrared (red) and visible (white, yellow) light.  X-ray: NASA/CXC/Caltech/S.Kulkarni et al.; Optical: NASA/STScI/UIUC/Y.H.Chu & R.Williams et al.; IR: NASA/JPL-Caltech/R.Gehrz et al. [PAR] In the supernova\u2019s wake, the core remains. This dense soup of subatomic particles has a couple of options at this point. For a star with less mass than 20 suns, the core holds together as a neutron star. But for the real stellar heavyweights, the core transforms into a truly exotic object. A black hole is born. [PAR] Stars thrive in a precarious balance. Gravity wants to pull the star together, internal pressure wants to tear it apart. The most drastic changes happen when one of these forces gets the upper hand. Above a core mass of a few suns, there is no known source of pressure that can balance gravity. The stellar remnant collapses upon itself. [PAR] Squeezing all that mass into a smaller and smaller volume makes the gravity at the dead star\u2019s surface skyrocket. Ratcheting up the gravity makes it increasingly difficult for anything to escape. Get the gravity high enough \u2013 about 30 thousand times what we feel here on Earth \u2013 and some truly bizarre side effects pop up. [PAR] This computer simulation shows a star being gravitationally torn apart by a nearby black hole.  Long streams of superheated gas mark out the star\u2019s final journey.

[PAR] Last Modified Date: 18 December 2016 [PAR] Copyright Protected: [PAR] You won't believe these 10 facts about people [PAR] Lignite is a brownish-black fossil fuel that is used primarily for electric power generation.  Considered to be a low-ranking type of coal , the fuel is usually categorized by geologists as a recent fuel.  Typically, it fits between peat and sub-bituminous coal on geological solid fuel ranking scales.  Lignite coal is burnable and may also be referred to as brown coal, earth coal, or Rosebud coal. [PAR] Geologically, lignite is believed to be relatively young in age.  Some geologists estimate that it formed roughly 251 million years ago, during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras.  In general, the fuel is thought to have been formed from peat at shallow depths and at temperatures less than 212\u00b0F (about 100\u00b0C).  Distinguishable plant remains can often be found in brown coal.  Additionally, the fuel frequently holds patterns from the wood from which it was derived. [PAR] Brown coal has a relatively high volatile matter content.  Consequently, it can be converted into liquid petroleum and gas products more easily than higher quality kinds of coal, such as bituminous coal or anthracite .  The fuel is also characterized by a high inherent moisture content , up to 75% in some cases.  Lignite ash content generally ranges between six and 19% while its carbon content makes up roughly 25% to 30%. [PAR] Brown coal can be more difficult to use than other types of coal.  For instance, it can be susceptible to spontaneous combustion, making transporting and storing it problematic.  Due to its transportation limitations, brown coal is often burned in a utility plant that has been set up near a lignite mine.  The fuel\u2019s high water content also makes disintegration more likely, further reducing its worth.  As a result of these limitations, brown coal is usually not traded on the world market as widely as higher grade coals. [PAR] There are a few major types of brown coal, which are usually categorized by structure.  Xyloid coal, also called fossil wood or bituminous wood, has the fibrous structure of wood.  Fibrous lignite often looks like peat in appearance and is comprised of approximately 50% water and 30% ashes.  Pitchy lignite, on the other hand, is more similar to coal in appearance. [PAR] Lignite mining occurs worldwide throughout Europe, Australia, the United States, and Russia.  Brown coal production is more common in areas where other types of fuel are scarce.  Some environmental concerns surround lignite mines because pollution emissions from a lignite plant are usually greater than emissions from other types of coal plants. [PAR] Ad[DOC] [TLE] Coal - Mineral Fact Sheets - Australian Mines AtlasCoal - Mineral Fact Sheets - Australian Mines Atlas [PAR] Suggestions for Further Reading [PAR] Introduction [PAR] Coal is a combustible rock of organic origin composed mainly of carbon (50-98 per cent), hydrogen (3-13 per cent) and oxygen, with lesser amounts of nitrogen, sulphur and other elements. Some water is always present, as are grains of inorganic matter that form an incombustible residue known as ash. [PAR] Coal is classified by rank, which is a measure of the amount of alteration it has undergone during formation. Consecutive stages in evolution of rank, from an initial peat stage, are brown coal (or lignite), sub-bituminous coal, bituminous coal, and anthracite. Increase in rank is due to a gradual increase in temperature and pressure that results in a decrease in water content and therefore an increase in carbon content. A continuous gradation occurs between these ranks. Sub-bituminous coal, bituminous coal and anthracite are together known as black coal. [PAR] The Industrial Revolution that began in Britain in the early 19th century was fuelled by coal. Then, in the 1950s and 1960s, it was eclipsed by petroleum as the world's most used fuel, but the oil shocks of the 1970s resulted in a\n\n\n### Answer:\nlignite </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

The size of the domino set depends on the largest number of dots, or pips, appearing on one side of the domino. A set of dominoes will have anywhere from 28 to 190 pieces. [PAR] History [PAR] Adri\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez de la Pe\u00f1a/Demand Media [PAR] Most evidence points to dominoes having been created by the Chinese, some time before A.D. 1120, when the official invention is credited to a statesman who presented a set of dominoes to Emperor Hui Tsung.

[PAR] Formula [PAR] Adri\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez de la Pe\u00f1a/Demand Media [PAR] A faster way of figuring out how many dominoes are in a set is by using a formula. When looking at the above list of dominoes, you notice that there are seven dominoes in the first set starting with 0, six starting with 1, five starting with 2, and so on to just one domino starting with 6. The total number of dominoes in the set is then 7+6+5+4+3+2+1=28. [PAR] The formula to find the number of dominoes in a set is (n+1)(n+2)/2, when n is the biggest number of dots that appears on one side of a domino.

History shows that the men in his family were mostly engineers and businessmen and Alfred was quick to follow in their footsteps. In 1842, Alfred and his family moved to St. Petersburg where his father, Immanuel Nobel, had built a factory for armament a few years earlier. His father used to manufacture land mines for the Tsar\u2019s army where he often made good profits. All throughout his life Alfred showed a lot of wit especially in his ability to quickly master foreign languages; he mastered four foreign languages. Alfred also showed great intelligence in natural sciences, especially in chemistry. [PAR] Work and Discoveries [PAR] In 1850 he went abroad to study chemical engineering. He travelled to Sweden, France, Germany and the United States before returning to Sweden in 1863. While in Sweden he devoted most of his time to the study of explosives. In particular, he was interested in the safe manufacture of a compound called nitro-glycerin. Nitro-glycerin is a highly unstable explosive. Nobel was interest in it mainly because his brother Emil has been killed in an explosion caused by the substance. He added the nitro-glycerin into silica. This made the compound safer and easier to manipulate. In 1867 he perfected the science and called it dynamite. Dynamite was what made Nobel one of the most famous chemists in history . Dynamite was then used all over the world for blasting tunnels, building railways, roads and cutting canals. Nobel went on to create many other kinds of explosives and his work was recognized all over the world. He even received an honorary award from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. They recognized his inventions which were of practical use to mankind. This award drove him to achieve many other science awards. [PAR] Life in Business [PAR] In the 1870\u2019s and 1880\u2019s Alfred was able to build quite a number of factories all over Europe that were used in the manufacturing of explosives. He bought an ironworks facility in Sweden in 1894 which later became the center of the famous Bofors arms factory. By the time Nobel died he had registered over 355 patents. [PAR] Nobel Prizes [PAR] It took quite some time before Alfred was able to write up his will. The final version of the will stated that all of his fortune should be reserved for presenting annual awards in the fields of chemistry, physics, medicine, literature and peace. An economics prize was also added later. Nobel died at his home in San Remo on December 10th, 1896 and is buried in Stockholm, Sweden. The contents of his will became known after his death. With this generosity and selflessness, Alfred Nobel founded the Nobel Prizes which have inspired and motivated many people in different fields.

[PAR] O'Hare vs. Midway - The Great Chicago Airport Debate [PAR] An ongoing debate for travellers to our city and Chicago residents alike is which airport to use: O'Hare or Midway. Of course, if you're travelling to most international destinations, your choice would be O'Hare. Midway only handles domestic flights and select service to Toronto and a few Mexican locales. In a city such as Chicago that is unfortunately known for its weather-related flight delays, it's important to take all things into consideration before booking. [PAR] O'Hare [PAR] O'Hare is the second busiest airport in the country, behind Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. This means that there are more options for flight times, but also more foot traffic and it's more crowded. The consensus from many travellers is that you must arrive at O'Hare well before your scheduled flight in order to allow ample time for check-in. Usually about 90 minutes prior to a domestic departure and 2 hours before flying internationally. Complaints of delayed flights seem to be more common at O'Hare than Midway as well, likely due to increased air traffic. Going through security is on par with what you would expect at any international airport, but is fairly efficient for the most part. [PAR] Convenient flight times often come with a cost. This means that while you may find four flights leaving at 2:00 from O'Hare and only one from Midway, you may be looking at a higher-priced airline ticket if you choose to fly out of the former. Southwest Airlines flights, which are often the cheapest option, are only available out of Midway. [PAR] O'Hare is home to a variey of restaurants, shopping, and other perks that you tend to find at larger airports. It definitely has the capacity to entertain travellers that are stuck there on layovers. Airport food tends to be on the expensive side and O'Hare is no exception. WiFi isn't free but is available for $6.95/day. [PAR] The airport is located about 45 minutes from downtown but it is easily accessible by both the 'L' and Metra. The cheapest parking at O'Hare can be found in Economy Lot F for $9/day. [PAR] Midway [PAR] Flights at Midway are dominated by Southwest Airlines, so passengers find it easier to book low-cost travel. The airport is smaller and much more passenger friendly/easier to navigate than it's larger counterpart. While still a busy airport, Midway has nowhere near the crowds and foot traffic encountered at O'Hare. [PAR] The Chicago Transit Authority's 'L' trains run to Midway. The trains can be boarded right inside the airport terminal and have a transit time of about 25 minutes to downtown and the Loop. If you are driving, Cicero Avenue can get pretty backed up so it's advisable to also plan an alternate route. Parking at Midway is $14/day in the cheapest lot. The Park 'n Fly lot has excellent reviews in terms of location, ease, and efficiency so that may be a good option to check out. [PAR] The airport itself offers less amenities than O'Hare, fewer restaurants choices and less shopping locations. However, there is still a decent selection of places to eat and the prices are reasonable. WiFi is free in the Southwest lounge, but other spots in the airport offer only 20 minutes of free access, after which it is $6.95 to continue. Plans are in the works for free WiFi at both O'Hare and Midway, but a definite start date hasn't been announced. [PAR] Regardless of which option you choose to fly in or out of our special city, I hope that you enjoy your time in Chicago. Bon voyage!

In the original series Bob appears as a building contractor specializing in masonry in a stop motion animated programme with his colleague Wendy, various neighbours and friends, and their gang of anthropomorphised work-vehicles and equipment, all made of clay. The show is broadcast in many countries, but originates from the United Kingdom where Bob is voiced by English actor Neil Morrissey. The show was later created using CGI animation starting with the spin-off series Ready, Steady, Build!. [PAR] In each episode, Bob and his group help with renovations, construction, and repairs and with other projects as needed. The show emphasizes conflict resolution, co-operation, socialization and various learning skills. Bob's catchphrase is Can we fix it?, to which the other characters respond with Yes we can! This phrase is also the title of the show's theme song, which was a million-selling number one hit in the UK. [PAR] In October 2014, Bob the Builder was revamped by Mattel for a new series to be aired on Channel 5's Milkshake! in 2015. Amongst the changes were a complete overhaul of the cast, with Harry Potter actor Lee Ingleby replacing Neil Morrissey as the voice of Bob, and Joanne Froggatt and Blake Harrison were also confirmed as the voices of Wendy and Scoop respectively.

[PAR] Sun Yat-sen (pinyin S\u016bn YiXi\u0101n) (12 November 1866 \u2013 12 March 1925) was a Chinese revolutionary and political leader. As the foremost pioneer of Republican China, Sun is frequently referred to as the Father of the Nation . Sun played an instrumental role in overthrowing the Qing Dynasty in October 1911, the last imperial dynasty of China. He was the first provisional president when the Republic of China (ROC) was founded in 1912 and later co-founded the Kuomintang (KMT) where he served as its first leader. Sun was a uniting figure in post-Imperial China , and remains unique among 20th-century Chinese politicians for being widely revered amongst the people from both sides of the Taiwan Strait . [PAR] Although Sun is considered one of the greatest leaders of modern China , his political life was one of constant struggle and frequent exile . After the success of the revolution, he quickly fell out of power in the newly founded Republic of China, and led successive revolutionary governments as a challenge to the warlords who controlled much of the nation. Sun did not live to see his party consolidate its power over the country. His party, which formed a fragile alliance with the Communists , split into two factions after his death. Sun's chief legacy resides in his developing a political philosophy known as the Three Principles of the People : nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood.

During childhood, he had the child name Dixiang (D\u00ecxi\u00e0ng, \u5e1d\u8c61). The courtesy name of Sun Yat-sen was Zaizhi (Z\u00e0izh\u012b, \u8f09\u4e4b), and his literary name was Rixin (R\u00ecx\u012bn, \u65e5\u65b0), later Yixian (Yat-sen, \u9038\u4ed9). He was also frequently called by the name Sun Zhongshan (\u5b6b\u4e2d\u5c71). [3] [PAR] Early years [PAR] Sun Yat-sen (back row, fifth from left) and his family. [PAR] Sun Yat-sen was born on 12 November 1866 to a Hakka family in the village of Cuiheng , Xiangshan (later Zhongshan ) county, Guangzhou prefecture, Guangdong province (26\u00a0km or 16 miles north of Macau ). [PAR] As a child, Sun Yat-sen listened to many stories about the Taiping Rebellion from an old Taiping soldier named Lai han-ying (\u8cf4\u6f22\u82f1). After receiving a few years of local school, at age thirteen, Sun went to live with his elder brother, Sun Mei, in Honolulu . Sun Mei, who was fifteen years Sun Yat-sen's senior, had emigrated to Hawaii as a laborer and had become a prosperous merchant . Though Sun Mei was not always supportive of Yat-sen's later revolutionary activities, he supported his brother financially, allowing Yat Sen to give up his professional career. Sun Yat-sen studied at the Iolani School where he learned English, mathematics and science. Originally unable to speak the English language, Sun Yat-sen picked up the language so quickly that he received a prize for outstanding achievement from Prince David Kalakaua .

According to one chronicler of Britannica history, Edinburgh in the mid-1700s was \"a city on the verge of a golden age, a center of learning and a home of writers, thinkers, and philosophers, wags, wits, and teachers.\" It was against this setting that Colin Macfarquhar, a printer, and Andrew Bell, an engraver, decided to create an encyclopedia that would serve the new era of scholarship and enlightenment. They formed a \"Society of Gentlemen\" to publish their new reference work and hired the twenty-eight-year-old scholar William Smellie to edit it. It would be arranged alphabetically, \"compiled upon a new plan in which the different Sciences and Arts are digested into distinct Treatises or Systems,\" and its chief virtue was to be, in the editor\u2019s word, \"utility.\" [PAR] The first edition of the Britannica was published one section at a time, in \"fascicles,\" over a three-year period, beginning in 1768. The three-volume set was completed in 1771 and quickly sold out. Encouraged by the success of the first edition, the publishers issued the second edition in 10 volumes (1777-84). The third edition, completed in 1797 and the first to include articles by outside contributors, comprised 18 volumes; the fourth, completed in 1809, boasted 20. The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica first came to the United States in the form of a pirated edition printed in Philadelphia in 1790 by Thomas Dobson. Owners of that set included George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton. Contributions from the leading scholars of the day began with a set of six volumes published in 1815-24 as a supplement to the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions. Contributors included Sir Walter Scott, Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, James Mill, and Thomas Young, whose pioneering efforts to penetrate the mystery of the Egyptian hieroglyphics on the Rosetta Stone first saw light of day under the Britannica imprint. [PAR] The ninth edition, published in 1875-89, is often remembered as the \"scholar's edition.\" It embodied as no other publication of the day the transformation of scholarship wrought by scientific discovery and new critical methods. In its pages Thomas Henry Huxley propounded Darwin's theory of evolution and W. Robertson Smith,\n\n\n### Answer:\n1768 </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Your task is to answer the following question.

Blistering banter ? Bullet-quick repartee? Totally bizarre statements issued with poker faces? We can't get enough of that tea-and-crumpet-infused hilarity. [PAR] And we're not the only ones. Think of American comedy shows like Veep, The Office, or Shameless\u2014all based on British shows. [PAR] But the U.K. invasion of comedy isn't a recent phenomenon. No, it's been infiltrating the global scene since the time when the sun never set on the British Empire. And one of the biggest names in comedy during the Victorian Era was Oscar Wilde. (He's Irish, but remember that Ireland was part of the Empire way back when.) [PAR] Wilde's comedy skewers Victorian England. He pokes fun of the entire social structure of fainting corset queens and mustachioed dandies... and still manages to be totally guffaw-provoking even today.\u00a0 [PAR] \"Life is too important a thing ever to talk seriously about it,\" wrote Wilde in Vera; or, The Nihilists . And boy does that statement echo throughout his career. This is a guy who experimented with achieving the perfect ratio of serious to trivial. And by the time Wilde wrote The Importance of Being Earnest, he had perfected his comedic recipe. [PAR] The Importance of Being Earnest debuted in London on February 14, 1895, when Wilde was at the height of his powers. But don't be fooled by the title. There is nothing earnest about this play, at least on the surface. It\u2019s a satire of the Victorian Era , when an intricate code of behavior governed everything from communication to sexuality. The most important rules applied to the farce of Victorian marriage\u2014a topic that hit home for Wilde, who was married to a woman but sexually involved with men. [PAR] During the Victorian period, marriage was about protecting your resources and keeping socially unacceptable impulses (like being gay) under control. We can see this at work in the The Importance of Being Earnest.\u00a0 The ridiculous end of the play\u2014three engagements in five minutes\u2014is a \"happy\" one because everyone gets together, but underneath this perfect comic ending there's more than a hint of darkness. [PAR] The characters only get together because their social and economic fitness for each other is demonstrated\u2014not because of true love. It's this hint of bitterness that makes the sweetness of Wilde's comedy all the more delicious... and insured his legacy as a founding father of modern U.K. comedy. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Why Should I Care? [PAR] We're all a little guilty of Bunburying. [PAR] No, you weirdos: that is not a sexy euphemism. It's a witty Wilde phrase that refers to pretending to have a prior engagement. We all know it's hard to be accepted as someone who contains multitudes . Sometimes you just need an alter-ego... or a really good alibi. [PAR] Maybe you're a lit nerd who tells his friends that he's going to see a Shakespeare play... and instead sneaks off to go to the rodeo. Maybe you're a lacrosse player... who also LARPs as an elf. Maybe you're a responsible gentleman who needs to cut loose every once in a while and decides to call himself \"Ernest\" while wreaking havoc in London. Or maybe you're a good-time socialite who needs some R&R and pretends to visit his ailing buddy Bunbury. [PAR] All the characters in The Importance of Being Earnest are Bunburying in one way or another. Jack pretends to be Ernest. Algernon \"visits\" his friend Bunbury. Cecily writes about a fictitious love affair in her diary. Miss Prism writes a novel. [PAR] Wait. Is anyone being earnest in this play? [PAR] According to Oscar Wilde, heck yes. For Wilde, a gay man in the hyper-repressive Victorian Era, it was necessary and absolutely imperative\u2014it was dang well earnest\u2014to divide yourself up when you\n\n\n### Answer:\noscar wilde </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

The exact amount of citric acid in one grapefruit will depend on a number of factors, most importantly the size of the fruit itself. By weight, grapefruits provide more citric acid than oranges but less than lemons or limes. [PAR] Citric Acid Content [PAR] Grapefruit juice contains about 25 grams of citric acid per liter, or 1,000 grams, of juice, according to a study published in the \"Journal of Endourology\" in March 2008. Each small grapefruit contains about 182 grams of juice, which means it has approximately 5 grams of citric acid. A medium grapefruit has about 233 grams of juice, so it provides approximately 6 grams of citric acid, and a large grapefruit contains about 302 grams of juice and provides approximately 8 grams of citric acid.

HOW TO SUPREME CITRUS FRUIT [PAR] Citrus fruits are native to the southern and southeastern mainland of Asia and the bordering Malayan islands. Their flowers smell sweet and they have five petals that are white and some kinds have purple staining the outer surfaces. The fruits are spherical or egg-shaped and have 8-14 juicy sections containing large, white or greenish seed leaves (cotyledons). These trees are cultivated in orchards or groves and in gardens where the climate and soil are suitable and as greenhouse plants. [PAR] Florida and California produce an abundant supply of Citrus fruits. Citrus trees require a minimum winter temperature of 45-50 degrees.

Instead, the all-female quintet derived from the dance-pop tradition that made Take That the most popular British group of the early '90s, but there was one crucial difference. Spice Girls used dance-pop as a musical base, but they infused the music with a fiercely independent, feminist stance that was equal parts Madonna, post-riot grrrl alternative rock feminism, and a co-opting of the good-times-all-the-time stance of England's new lad culture. Their proud, all-girl image and catchy dance-pop appealed to younger listeners, while their colorful, sexy personalities and sense of humor appealed to older music fans, making Spice Girls a cross-generational success. The group also became chart-toppers throughout Europe in 1996, before concentrating in America in early 1997. [PAR] Every member of Spice Girls was given a specific identity by the British press from the outset, and each label was as much an extension of their own personality as it was a marketing tool, since each name derived from their debut single and video, \"Wannabe.\" Geri Estelle Halliwell was the \"sexy Spice\"; Melanie Janine Brown was the \"scary Spice\"; Victoria Adams was \"the posh Spice\"; Melanie Jayne Chisholm was \"the sporty Spice\"; Emma Lee Bunton was \"the baby Spice.\" Each persona was exploited in the group's press articles and videos, which helped send \"Wannabe\" to the top of the charts upon its summer release in 1996. If all of the invented personalities made Spice Girls seem manufactured, that's because they were to a certain extent. Every member of the group was active in England's theatrical, film, and modeling circuit before the group's formation, and they all responded to an advertisement requesting five \"lively girls\" for a musical group in the summer of 1993. The manager who placed the ad chose all five members of Spice Girls, yet the women rejected his plans for their career and set out on their own two months after forming. For the next two years, the Girls fought to get a record contract, since most record labels insisted that the band pick one member as a clear leader, which is something the group refused. [PAR] Eventually, Spice Girls signed a contract to Virgin Records. They were without a manager, though, which made recording a debut album nearly impossible. All five members moved into a house and went on the dole as they searched for a manager. By the end of 1995, the group had signed with Annie Lennox's manager Simon Fuller, and began writing songs with Elliot Kennedy. \"Wannabe,\" Spice Girls' first single, was released in the summer of 1996 and became the first debut single by an all-female band to enter the British charts at number one. It remained there for seven weeks, and by the end of the year, \"Wannabe\" had hit number one in 21 other countries. Immediately following the success of \"Wannabe,\" Spice Girls became media icons in Britain as stories of their encounters with other celebrities became fodder for numerous tabloids, as did nude photos of Halliwell that she posed for earlier in her career. All of this added to the group's momentum, and their second single, \"Say You'll Be There,\" entered the charts at number one in the fall, selling 200,000 copies a week. Spice, their debut album, was released at the end of the year, accompanied by their first ballad, \"2 Become 1.\" Both the album and single went directly to number one, staying there for several weeks; both records were at number one over the Christmas week, making Spice Girls one of three artists to achieve that feat. [PAR] Having topped the charts in virtually every other country in the Western world, Spice Girls concentrated on America in early 1997, releasing \"Wannabe\n\n\n### Answer:\nwannabe </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

However, Sullivan was unhappy with this, so for the second series he persuaded the BBC to use his own compositions instead, partly because the new lyrics would explain the obscure title, which had been the subject of viewers' questions to the BBC during the first series. [PAR] The first series was subsequently re-edited to use the new theme songs, though the first episode, \"Big Brother\", is still sometimes repeated with the original Hazlehurst music intact, as is the 1981 Christmas special. The current DVD release of Series One, however, replaces the theme music on all seven episodes. The original theme music is still used in the first episode during a montage in which Del unsuccessfully conducts business throughout Peckham whilst trying to sell stolen breifcases. [PAR] The lyrics to the established themes contain both slang and references to British culture, and describe elements of the show. The opening lyrics include \"stick a pony in my pocket\", pony being London slang for 25 pounds sterling;[58] \"fetch the suitcase from the van\" and \"where it all comes from is a mystery\", all references to the Trotters' shady, cash-only business. It ends with the title lyric, \"why do only fools and horses work?\" The closing theme follows suit, describing the dubious goods that the Trotters specialise in, from \"miles and miles of carpet tiles\" to \"Trevor Francis tracksuits\"; Francis was an English football player during the 1970s and 1980s. These are \"from a mush in Shepherd's Bush\"; mush is slang for a man whose name is unknown and Shepherd's Bush is a West London district.The line \"no income tax, no VAT\" summarises their outlook, before closing with the refrain \"God bless Hooky Street\". Hooky is British slang for something stolen or which has been acquired illegally. The images peeling away was conceived as a metaphor for the Trotters' lifestyle [PAR] Both songs are performed by Sullivan, and not \u2013 as is sometimes thought \u2013 by Nicholas Lyndhurst.Sullivan had intended for Chas & Dave to sing it, since they were an act associated with Cockney-style music, but they were unavailable having just recorded a hit record with \"Ain't No Pleasing You\", so he was persuaded to do it himself by Ray Butt.The new theme was also arranged by Hazlehurst. Chas & Dave did later contribute to the show, performing \"Down to Margate\", the closing credits song for \"The Jolly Boys' Outing\". [PAR] The opening credits see images of the three principal actors peel on and off the screen sequentially like adhesive labels. These appear over a background of still photographs of everyday life in South London, including a used car lot and a tower block. The sequence was conceived by graphic designer, Peter Clayton, as a \"metaphor for the vagaries of the Trotters' lifestyle\", whereby money was earned and quickly lost again. The action was shot manually frame by frame, and took around six weeks to complete. [PAR] As the series progressed, the sequence was occasionally updated with new footage, but it only ever featured Del, Rodney and either Grandad or Uncle Albert. The 2001\u20132003 trilogy featured just Del and Rodney. In total, the shots of Del and Rodney were updated three times during the series' run to reflect their ageing, whilst Grandad and Uncle Albert only ever received one version each during their run. The 2001-2003 Christmas specials used the same titles sequences but rendered for broadcast in the now standard 16:9 ratio widescreen.

Ford is set to appear in a sequel to the 1982 sci-fi classic, this time under the direction of Denis Villeneuve. Ridley Scott will executive produce. [PAR] The Los Angeles Times noted Ford is also starring in the upcoming Star Wars: The Force Awakens film as Han Solo, due out next year. Ford first starred as Solo in 1977 when the George Lucas-penned classic hit theaters. He would do two more Star Wars films in the 1980s while he had a string of hits with the Indiana Jones franchise. [PAR] In addition to bringing back Deckard and Solo, Ford returned to Indiana Jones in 2008 for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Ford apparently does not shy away from returning to his old hits. [PAR] Blade Runner followed Deckard, an L.A. cop who pursued androids. The movie was set in 2019. It also starred Rutger Hauer, Sean Young and Daryl Hannah. The new movie will take place many years after the first film\u2019s timeframe.

[PAR] The novel that would become Blade Runner was called Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. Dick read an early script for Blade Runner and approved although a primary theme in his novel, the \u201cmisfortune of animals,\u201d according to Time, had been removed. Dick also spoke highly of an early cut of the film but died before the final version hit theaters. [PAR] The movie performed poorly at the U.S. box office in 1982 but eventually became a cult classic. Ridley Scott started talking about a revisit to Blade Runner in 2011. [PAR] Ford, 72, suffered an injury on-set last year while filming Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

[PAR] Although less than a hundred episodes of the series are believed to be in existence, the episodes that have been selected for this release reveal the diversity of subjects that were covered in Magpie, from dramatised accounts of the Civil War (in which Susan Stranks plays the role of a conflicted daughter of a Royalist) to Douglas Rae and Jenny Hanley investigating the workings of a barge. Elsewhere, Tommy Boyd takes part in a naval exercise, training how to escape from a sinking ship, and Mick Robertson, Douglas Rae and Jenny Hanley take a trip through France. [PAR] The series benefits greatly from both its diverse and engaging subject matter and the overall warmth of its presenters. Never patronising its young viewers, the episodes in this set cover a huge variety of topics, both contemporary and historical. Quite simply, revisiting these episodes of Magpie highlights the lack of scope and ambition of much of modern children\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds television (and, arguably, factual programming in general): Magpie\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds factual slots are genuinely informative and, as noted above, do not patronise their viewers.

There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the crust of Earth.  [PAR] Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe. However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter is only approximately 15% of the matter in the universe: the remainder is dark matter, the composition of which is unknown, but it is not composed of chemical elements.  [PAR] The two lightest elements, hydrogen and helium were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe. The next three elements (lithium, beryllium and boron) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation, and are thus more rare than those that follow. Formation of elements with from six to twenty six protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis. The high abundance of oxygen, silicon, and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars. Elements with greater than twenty-six protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae, which, when they explode, blast these elements far into space as supernova remnants, where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed.  [PAR] The term \"element\" is used for a kind of atoms with a given number of protons (regardless of whether they are or they are not ionized or chemically bonded, e.g. hydrogen in water) as well as for a pure chemical substance consisting of a single element (e.g. hydrogen gas). For the second meaning, the terms \"elementary substance\" and \"simple substance\" have been suggested, but they have not gained much acceptance in the English-language chemical literature, whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used (e.g. French corps simple, Russian \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e). One element can form multiple substances different by their structure; they are called allotropes of the element. [PAR] When different elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held together by chemical bonds, they form chemical compounds.  Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals. Among the more common of such \"native elements\" are copper, silver, gold, carbon (as coal, graphite, or diamonds), and sulfur. All but a few of the most inert elements, such as noble gases and noble metals, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements occur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel. [PAR] The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold. Later civilizations extracted elemental copper, tin, lead and iron from their ores by smelting, using charcoal. Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more, with almost all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900. [PAR] The properties of the chemical elements are summarized on the periodic table, which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows (\"periods\") in which the columns (\"groups\") share recurring (\"periodic\") physical and chemical properties. Save for unstable radioactive elements with short half-lives, all of the elements are available industrially, most of them in high degrees of purity. [PAR] Description [PAR] The lightest chemical elements are hydrogen and helium, both created by Big Bang nucleosynthesis during the first 20 minutes of the universe  in a ratio of around 3:1 by mass (or 12:1 by number of atoms),   along with tiny traces of\n\n\n### Answer:\nhelium </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] Sociologists have found the worse the economy, the longer the women's skirts are and the better economy, the shorter the skirt. [PAR] Advertisements[DOC] [TLE] AlphabetAn alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based on the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit). [PAR] The Proto-Canaanite script, later known as the Phoenician alphabet, is the first fully phonemic script. Thus the Phoenician alphabet is considered to be the first alphabet. The Phoenician alphabet is the ancestor of most modern alphabets, including Arabic, Greek, Latin, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and possibly Brahmic.  According to terminology introduced by Peter T. Daniels, an \"alphabet\" is a script that represents both vowels and consonants as letters equally. In this narrow sense of the word the first \"true\" alphabet was the Greek alphabet,   which was developed on the basis of the earlier Phoenician alphabet. In other alphabetic scripts such as the original Phoenician, Hebrew or Arabic, letters predominantly or exclusively represent consonants; such a script is also called an abjad. A third type, called abugida or alphasyllabary, is one where vowels are shown by diacritics or modifications of consonantal base letters, as in Devanagari and other South Asian scripts. [PAR] There are dozens of alphabets in use today, the most popular being the Latin alphabet  (which was derived from the Greek). Many languages use modified forms of the Latin alphabet, with additional letters formed using diacritical marks.  While most alphabets have letters composed of lines (linear writing), there are also exceptions such as the alphabets used in Braille. [PAR] Alphabets are usually associated with a standard ordering of letters. This makes them useful for purposes of collation, specifically by allowing words to be sorted in alphabetical order. It also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of \"numbering\" ordered items, in such contexts as numbered lists and number placements. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The English word alphabet came into Middle English from the Late Latin word alphabetum, which in turn originated in the Greek \u1f00\u03bb\u03c6\u03ac\u03b2\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (alphab\u0113tos), from alpha and beta, the first two letters of the Greek alphabet.  Alpha and beta in turn came from the first two letters of the Phoenician alphabet, and originally meant ox and house respectively. [PAR] Informally the term \"ABCs\" is sometimes used for the alphabet as in the alphabet song (Now I know my ABCs ...), and knowing one's ABCs for literacy, or as a metaphor for knowing the basics about anything.  [PAR] History [PAR] Ancient Northeast African and Middle Eastern scripts [PAR] The history of the alphabet started in ancient Egypt. By the 27th century BC Egyptian writing had a set of some 24 hieroglyphs that are called uniliterals,  to represent syllables that begin with a single consonant of their language, plus a vowel (or no vowel) to be supplied by the native speaker. These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for logograms, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and foreign names.Daniels and Bright (1996), pp. 74\u201375 [PAR] In the Middle Bronze Age an apparently \"alphabetic\" system known\n\n\n### Answer:\nq </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

None will ever take it's place. A position no doubt dictated by the age we were when first viewing it. As with films like \"Star Wars\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", WHEN you experience them is just as important as HOW you experience them. [PAR] As we age, youth's eyes fade. Cynicism creeps in. Experience leads us to see the many injustices this life offers and we become more critical... less likely to accept that which we would rather believe.

Our skeleton's bone mass is at its maximum density  around the age of 30. [PAR] If broken our bones will re-grow and  repair themselves. Often doctors will place a cast on splint to make sure these  bones repair straight and true. [PAR] The axial skeleton part of the human  skeleton has 80 bones. It includes the vertebral column, the rib cage and the  skull and helps us maintain our upright posture, by spreading the weight in the  head, and upper areas down to the lower areas near the hips. [PAR] The appendicular skeletal section of  our skeleton has 126 bones. It includes the pectoral (shoulder) girdles, the  pelvic girdle and the bones of the lower and upper limbs. Its function is for  movement of the body and to protect some organs. [PAR] The human skeletal system has six  major functions including the production of blood cells, for support, for movement, for  protection, for storage of ions and endocrine regulation. [PAR] The longest bone in the human body  is the thigh bone called the femur. [PAR] The smallest bone found in the human  body is located in the middle ear. The staples (or stirrup) bone is only 2.8  millimetres (0.11 inches) long. [PAR] Like our skin , the human body's  bones are also constantly worn down and re-made, to the point where every 7  years we essentially have a new bone. [PAR] The area of our body with the most  bones is the hand, fingers and wrist where there are 54 bones. [PAR] Our teeth form part of the skeletal  system, but are not counted as bones. [PAR] There a just a few differences  between human male and female skeletons. The female skeleton is generally  slightly smaller and the pelvis bones differ in shape, size and angle in order  to assist with child birth. [PAR] The majority of human bones have a  dense, strong outer layer, followed by a spongy part full of air for lightness,  while the middle contains a soft, flexible, tissue substance called bone  marrow. [PAR] Bone marrow makes up 4% of a human  body mass. It produces red blood cells which carry oxygen all over the body.  Marrow is also produces lymphocytes, key components of the lymphatic system,  which support the body's immune system. [PAR] Calcium is very important for our  bones and helps keep them strong and healthy. [PAR] The areas where our bones meet are  called joints. The joints in our cranium have no movement while our hip joints  allow for a wide range of movement. [PAR] Bones are held in place at joints by  muscles and also tissues called ligaments. Another type of tissue called  cartilage covers each bone joint surface area to prevent the bones rubbing. [PAR] The medical branch of learning about  the human skeletal system is called Orthopedics.

These quickly entered the national consciousness. [PAR] Amongst these characters was the Greek kebab-seller with markedly fractured English, \"Stavros\", a profound supporter of the football club Arsenal F.C., which he demonstrated by frequently uttering the phrase \"Up the Arse\". [PAR] His other popular character \"Loadsamoney\" (an obnoxious character who constantly boasted about how much money he earns) spawned a hit single in 1988 and sell out live tour. As a foil to \"Loadsamoney\" Enfield and Whitehouse created the Geordie \"Bugger-All-Money\" and in 1988 Enfield appeared as both characters during the 'Nelson Mandela Birthday Tribute Concert' at Wembley Stadium. In time Whitehouse and Enfield became disturbed that the \"Loadsamoney\" was being seen as a positive image and killed him off. In 1989 Enfield realised a personal project with the spoof of British Theatre Knights slumming in the film industry Sir Norbert Smith: A Life. [PAR] Before that he provided voices for the British satirical puppet show Spitting Image. [PAR] In 1990, Enfield moved to the BBC where he developed his sketch show, Harry Enfield's Television Programme, and later Harry Enfield and Chums with fellow comedians Paul Whitehouse (later of Fast Show fame) and Kathy Burke. This created more nationally recognised characters such as \"Mr. and Mrs. Loadsamoney\", \"Tim, nice but dim\" (a character frighteningly similar to the British Conservative politician Boris Johnson), \"Smashie and Nicey\", \"Wayne Slob\" and \"Annoying Kid Brother\" who grew into \"Kevin The Teenager\". Two characters played by Enfield and Jon Glover, Mr Cholmondley-Warner and Grayson appeared for several years both in the series' mock 1950s information film sketches, and in television commercials for the first of the privatised UK telephone companies, Mercury Communications. Enfield is a professed fan of classical opera and for Channel 4 fronted a documentary series on the subject. [PAR] His first sitcom appearance came in 1992, when he played \"Dermot\" in Men Behaving Badly on ITV. He left after the first series, and was replaced by Neil Morrissey, who played 'Tony' in the subsequent five series, and various one-off specials. [PAR] In 2000 Enfield appeared in a his first leading film role playing \"Kevin\" alongside Kathy Burke, who played the character's male friend \"Perry\" - roles originally created for the television series - in Kevin & Perry Go Large. The film charted the pair's attempt to become professional DJs by travelling to the nightclubs of Ibiza and molesting their idol DJ \"Eyeball Paul\", played by Rhys Ifans, whilst gaining love but losing virginity along the way. [PAR] Enfield appearances in commercials have been prolific, including the 1996 run for Dime Bar. (One memorable commercial in this series had Enfield as a country yokel refusing a Dime bar with its crunchy centre because he preferred armadilloes - soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.) In 2004, he starred in a series of commercials for Burger King in the US as Dr. Angus, a character designed to promote the company's newest hamburger. [PAR] After a short break Enfield signed a new contract with BSkyB, but only produced one series which flopped badly. In 2002 Enfield returned to the BBC with Celeb, a new series based on the comic strip of the same name in Private Eye, as the ageing rockstar character, Gary Bloke. [PAR] As of 2004, Enfield provided the voice of \"The Roaming Gnome\" character used in Travelocity's US advertising campaign. [PAR] He has a son and two daughters with his second wife, Lucy.

[PAR] The term includes some types of red, brown, and green algae. Seaweed can also be classified by use (as food, medicine,  fertilizer, filtration, industrial, etc.). [PAR] Taxonomy  [PAR] A seaweed may belong to one of several groups of multicellular algae: the red algae, green algae, and brown algae. As these three groups do not have a common multicellular ancestor, the seaweed are in a polyphyletic group. In addition, some tuft-forming bluegreen algae (Cyanobacteria) are sometimes considered to be seaweed \u2014 \"seaweed\" is a colloquial term and lacks a formal definition. [PAR] Structure  [PAR] Seaweed's appearance somewhat resembles non-arboreal terrestrial plants. [PAR] * thallus: the algal body [PAR] ** lamina or blade: a flattened structure that is somewhat leaf-like [PAR] *** sorus: a spore cluster [PAR] *** on Fucus, air bladder: a floatation-assisting organ on the blade [PAR] *** on kelp, float: a floatation-assisting organ between the lamina and stipe [PAR] ** stipe: a stem-like structure, may be absent [PAR] ** holdfast: a specialized basal structure providing attachment to a surface, often a rock or another alga [PAR] ** haptera: a finger-like extension of the holdfast anchoring to a benthic substrate [PAR] The stipe and blade are collectively known as the frond. [PAR] Ecology  [PAR] Two specific environmental requirements dominate seaweed ecology. These are the presence of seawater (or at least brackish water) and the presence of light sufficient to drive photosynthesis. Another common requirement is a firm attachment point, although some genera such as Sargassum and Gracilaria have species that float freely. As a result, seaweed most commonly inhabit the  part of a sea that is close to the shore (the littoral zone) and within that zone more frequently on rocky shores than on sand or shingle. Seaweed occupy a wide range of ecological niches. The highest elevation is only wetted by the tops of sea spray, the lowest is several meters deep. In some areas, littoral seaweed can extend several miles out to sea. The limiting factor in such cases is sunlight availability. The deepest living seaweed are some species of red algae. [PAR] Others have adapted to live in tidal rock pools. In this habitat seaweed must withstand rapidly changing temperature and salinity and even occasional drying.  [PAR] Uses  [PAR] Seaweed has a variety of purposes, for which it is farmed  or foraged from the wild.  [PAR] At the beginning of 2011, Indonesia produced 3 million tonnes of seaweed and surpassed the Philippines as the world's largest seaweed producer. By 2011, the production was estimated to have reached 10 million tonnes.  [PAR] Food  [PAR] Seaweed are consumed by coastal people, particularly in East Asia, e.g. Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia, e.g. Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, and Malaysia, and also in South Africa, Belize, Peru, Chile, the Canadian Maritimes, Scandinavia, South West England,  Ireland, Wales, California, and Scotland. [PAR] In Asia, Gim (Korean food) (\uae40, Korea), nori (\u6d77\u82d4, Japan), zicai (\u7d2b\u83dc, China) are sheets of dried Porphyra used in soups, sushi wrap or onigiri also known as rice ball. Chondrus crispus (commonly known as 'Irish moss' or carrageenan moss) is another red alga used in producing food additives, along with Kappaphycus and gigartinoid seaweed. Porphyra is a red alga used in Wales to make laver. Laverbread, made from oats and the laver, is a popular dish there. In northern Belize, edible seaweed are mixed with milk, nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla to make a common beverage affectionately called \"dulce\" (or \"sweet\").

Allowances may be made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers. Examples in English include \"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!\", \"Amor, Roma\", \"race car\", \"stack cats\", \"step on no pets\", \"taco cat\", \"put it up\", \"Was it a car or a cat I saw?\" and \"No 'x' in Nixon\". [PAR] Composing literature in palindromes is an example of constrained writing. [PAR] The word \"palindrome\" was coined by the English playwright Ben Jonson in the 17th century from the Greek roots ' (; \"again\") and ' (; \"way, direction\"). [PAR] History [PAR] Palindromes date back at least to 79 AD, as a palindrome was found as a graffito at Herculaneum, a city buried by ash in that year. This palindrome, called the Sator Square, consists of a sentence written in Latin: \"Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas\" (\"The sower Arepo holds with effort the wheels\"). It is remarkable for the fact that the first letters of each word form the first word, the second letters form the second word, and so forth. Hence, it can be arranged into a word square that reads in four different ways: horizontally or vertically from either top left to bottom right or bottom right to top left. As such, they can be referred to as palindromatic.  [PAR] A palindrome with the same property is the Hebrew palindrome, \"We explained the glutton who is in the honey was burned and incinerated\", (\u05e4\u05e8\u05e9\u05e0\u05d5\u00a0\u05e8\u05e2\u05d1\u05ea\u05df\u00a0\u05e9\u05d1\u05d3\u05d1\u05e9\u00a0\u05e0\u05ea\u05d1\u05e2\u05e8\u00a0\u05d5\u05e0\u05e9\u05e8\u05e3; perashnu: ra`avtan shebad'vash nitba'er venisraf), by Abraham ibn Ezra, referring to the halachic question as to whether a fly landing in honey makes the honey treif (non-kosher). [PAR] The palindromic Latin riddle \"In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni\" (\"we go wandering at night and are consumed by fire\") describes the behavior of moths. It is likely that this palindrome is from medieval rather than ancient times. [PAR] Byzantine Greeks often inscribed the palindrome, \"Wash [the] sins, not only [the] face\"  (\"N\u012bpson anom\u0113mata m\u0113 m\u014dnan \u014dpsin\", engraving \"ps\" with the single Greek letter \u03a8, psi), on baptismal fonts. This practice was continued in many English churches. Examples include the font at St. Mary's Church, Nottingham and also the font in the basilica of St. Sophia, Constantinople, the font of St. Stephen d'Egres, Paris; at St. Menin's Abbey, Orl\u00e9ans; at Dulwich College; and at the following churches: Worlingworth (Suffolk), Harlow (Essex), Knapton (Norfolk), St Martin, Ludgate (London), and Hadleigh (Suffolk). [PAR] Types [PAR] Characters, words, or lines [PAR] The most familiar palindromes in English are character-unit palindromes. The characters read the same backward as forward. Some examples of palindromic words are redivider, noon, civic, radar, level, rotor, kayak, reviver, racecar, redder, madam, and refer. [PAR] There are also word-unit palindromes in which the unit of reversal is the word (\"Is it crazy how saying sentences backwards creates backwards sentences saying how crazy it is?\"). Word-unit palindromes were made popular in the recreational linguistics community by J. A. Lindon in the 1960s. Occasional examples in English were created in the 19th century. Several in French and Latin date to the Middle Ages.  [PAR] There are also line-unit palindromes.  [PAR] Sentences and phrases [PAR] Palindromes often consist of a sentence or phrase, e.g., \"Eva, can I stab bats in a cave?\", \"Mr. Owl ate my metal worm\", \"Was it a car or a cat I saw?\", \"A nut for a jar of tuna\", \"Do geese see God?\", \"Ma is as selfless as\n\n\n### Answer:\nracecar </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

It has been sung hundreds of millions of times each year for over three-quarters of a century. It has been heard in outer space, at baseball stadiums, in movies and in domiciles from the White House to the most remote backwoods shack in Mississippi. It has been wired in to millions of music boxes, greeting cards, watches, toys, games and other tune-playing products. And it is the only song in the English language guaranteed to make people of all ages smile and sing along. The song, of course, is \u201cHappy Birthday to You.\u201d [PAR] This amazingly sturdy four-line ditty began its life in 1893. Written by two sisters from Kentucky, Mildred and Patty Hill, it was originally entitled \u201cGood Morning to All,\u201d and intended as a classroom greeting from teachers to students: [PAR] Good morning to you [PAR] Good morning, dear children [PAR] Good morning to all. [PAR] Patty Hill was a nursery school and kindergarten teacher (she would later develop \u201cPatty Hill blocks,\u201d a popular toy for children). Her older sister Mildred, who was also a teacher for a time, went on to become a noted composer, organist and music scholar, with a specialty in Negro spirituals. Mildred came up with the melody for \u201cGood Morning to All.\u201d Patty added the words. [PAR] The Hills\u2019 modest tune (a range of six notes, repetitive lyric and an average running time of about 12 seconds) was first published in 1893 as part of a songbook, Song Stories for the Kindergarten. Over the next 30 years it spread, evolving first into a greeting for students to sing to their teachers, rather than vice-versa. Then it became the more generic \u201cGood Morning to You,\u201d with the name of whomever the song was being sung to inserted in the third line. This minor but significant change brought it a little closer to its final version. [PAR] But here\u2019s where the mystery is: To this day, no one knows for sure who wrote the new words to Mildred Hill\u2019s melody, or exactly when it happened. \u201cHappy Birthday to You\u201d first appeared in a songbook in 1924, edited by Robert H. Coleman. The words were presented as an alternate second stanza to \u201cGood Morning to You\u201d (perhaps Coleman was the uncredited lyricist?). Aided by the advent of radio and sound movies, this new stanza became hugely popular and soon overshadowed the original lyric. By the mid-\u201930s, the celebratory tune had appeared in several films and a Broadway musical, and had been used for Western Union\u2019s first singing telegram.

[PAR] The second half of your question we do have an answer for, it\u2019s just a little mind bending and hard to picture.\u00a0 What heavy objects are bending is space itself. The way you detect space (follow me here) is with rulers or stretched out strings, or stuff like that.\u00a0 Anything that measures distance.\u00a0 Near heavy objects the distance between points is greater than you would expect, and you can use this fact to detect and measure the stretching of space. [PAR] The usual trick when trying to picture higher dimensional space is to knock off a couple of dimensions, and picture that instead.\u00a0 3 dimensions is too complicated, and 1 is stupid, so here\u2019s 2!

[PAR] That is, the diameter you get by measuring the equator and dividing by [PAR] ( [PAR] ) is the \u201cflat space diameter\u201d, the diameter you get by physically dropping a rope through the planet is the true, \u201ccurved space diameter\u201d, and the difference between these two is 18mm.

In all the programs I,ve watched the diagrams all indicate that the moving mass tents to bend it\u2019s  surrounding near space beneath itself, which indicates that the body\u2019s mass distorts the space beneath it.However if space itself is void of mass how can it be distorted in any direction let alone in only one direction.If space is not a true void, i.e.space is made up of some form of mass then surely a moving body travelling through space would distort space all around it.Yes I know I\u2019m thick!!!

[PAR] Guy Fawkes was born in 1570 in Stonegate, York. [PAR] His father died when he was only eight years old. [PAR] Guy\u2019s mother\u2019s family were outwardly Protestant (as England was a Protestant country during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I), but secretly Catholic. By the time he was a teenager, Guy was also a Catholic. [PAR] Guy became a soldier, fighting for Catholic countries against their Protestant enemies. He fought for Spain against the Dutch in the Eighty Year\u2019s War. [PAR] During the reign of James I, Guy Fawkes became increasingly frustrated at the continued persecution of Catholics and the fact that a Scottish monarch was the King of England. He travelled to Spain to try and get support for a Catholic rebellion in England. He failed this attempt, but he did meet some of the people who would later be involved in setting up The Gunpowder Plot. [PAR] Facts About The Gunpowder Plot [PAR] Although Guy Fawkes is the most famous of those involved in The Gunpowder Plot, it was actually Robert Catesby who was the leader of the failed attempt to kill James I when he opened Parliament in 1605. [PAR] The plotters, led by Robert Catesby, were: Guy Fawkes, Thomas Wintour, Robert Wintour, John Wright, Thomas Percy, Robert Keyes, Thomas Bates, John Grant, Christopher Wright, Sir Ambrose Rookwood, Francis Tresham and Sir Everard Digby. [PAR] The plotters planned to set off 36 barrels of gunpowder in a cellar (called an undercroft) directly under the House of Lords, killing King James I and other key Protestant members of the Royal Family and Privy Council. [PAR] \u00a0Guy Fawkes, due to his experience as a soldier, was placed in charge of lighting the gunpowder fuse. [PAR] The plot failed because an anonymous letter was received by Baron Monteagle (a Catholic who would have been in the House of Lords on 5th November) warning him to stay away to guarantee his safety. The letter was passed to James I and he ordered that the buildings around the House of Lords be thoroughly searched. [PAR] Guy Fawkes was found in the cellar under the House of Lords carrying a lantern, a pocket watch and several matches. Thirty six barrels of gunpowder were also revealed, hidden under a stack of firewood. [PAR] Guy Fawkes was arrested. King James I gave his permission for Guy Fawkes to be tortured and he finally confessed to his part in The Gunpowder Plot. He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered on 31st January 1606. [PAR] Although he did die on 31st January, Guy Fawkes managed to avoid the agony of being quartered (cut open while still conscious) by jumping from the gallows and breaking his neck. [PAR] Bonfire Night (sometimes called Guy Fawke\u2019s Night or Firework Night) [PAR] The fact that the Gunpowder Plot failed was celebrated on 5th November 1606 (the year after the event) and on this day every year since. Church bells used to be rung and bonfires were lit. [PAR] Traditionally, effigies (life size models) of Guy Fawkes were made by children out of straw, newspaper and rags. These were known as \u2018Guys\u2019 and they were thrown onto bonfires and burnt. Fireworks were also set off on the night of 5th November. [PAR] Many of these traditions still take place in England today, although lots of children don\u2019t know the exact reason behind the celebration.[DOC] [TLE] The Gunpowder Plot - Britain ExpressThe Gunpowder Plot [PAR] The Gunpowder Plot [PAR] Guy Fawkes [PAR] Overview [PAR] The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was an attempt to kill James I, King of England.

Ridley's older brother, Frank, joined the Merchant Navy when he was still young and the pair had little contact. During this time the family moved around, living in (amongst other areas) Cumbria, Wales and Germany. After the Second World War the Scott family moved back to their native north-east England, eventually settling in Teesside (whose industrial landscape would later inspire similar scenes in Blade Runner ). He enjoyed watching films, and his favourites include Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai. Scott studied in Teesside from 1954 to 1958, at Grangefield Grammar School and later in West Hartlepool College of Art, graduating with a Diploma in Design. He progressed to an M.A. in graphic design at the Royal College of Art from 1960 to 1962.

Not even kidding.\u00a0 Joanne Green / Getty Images [PAR] By Danilo Alfaro [PAR] Updated December 12, 2016. [PAR] Haggis is a Scottish dish made of the heart, liver and lungs of a sheep or lamb , combined with oats, suet and other herbs and spices , and then cooked in a casing traditionally made of the animal's stomach. Thus, haggis is essentially a form of sausage. [PAR] With that said, charcuterie , or the traditional art of sausage-making, came about as a way to utilize all the edible parts of the pig, and also to preserve it. In the case of haggis, it does indeed utilize what some culinarians affectionately term \"the nasty bits.\" [PAR] But unlike sausage, there is no thought of preserving the haggis once it is stuffed in its casing. With haggis, the feeling is one of \"why wait until next week or next month to enjoy something you can serve today?\" [PAR] In a typical recipe, the haggis ingredients , including the organ meats, are cooked and then chopped, seasoned and enclosed in the stomach lining, which is then tied with cooking twine. The trussed haggis is then simmered for several hours. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] How to Prevent Your Cutting Board from Sliding [PAR] The stomach must be soaked in salted water before preparing the haggis, and in some preparations it is turned inside out before filling. The stomach must be pierced a few times before cooking the haggis so that steam will escape, otherwise it could burst. [PAR] Haggis is traditionally served with mashed potatoes and pur\u00e9ed turnips, a combination known as \"tatties and neeps.\" The spices used in seasoning a haggis usually include cayenne pepper , allspice and sometimes nutmeg. [PAR] Bearing in mind that for the average 17th-century peasant, slaughtering a sheep was not something that happened every day. And since each sheep possessed exactly one stomach, one heart, one set of lungs, it made sense that consuming a haggis came to be considered a very special occasion. [PAR] For formal occasions, the cooked haggis can be served on a platter with the stomach casing split open. Or portions of haggis can be scooped out and served on individual plates. [PAR] Modern haggis recipes can involve cooking the haggis ingredients in an artificial casing, or simply baked in a loaf pan using no casing at all. [PAR] Haggis is the highlight of the traditional Scottish Burns Supper, which is a celebration held on or around the birthday of Scottish poet Robert Burns. Burns wrote a poem called \"Address to a Haggis\" in which he praises the dish as \"Great chieftain o' the puddin'-race.\" [PAR] The haggis is carried into the dining room as the guests stand and bagpipes are played. Later, the host will recite Address to a Haggis, which is followed by a toast of Scotch whisky, at which point the meal of haggis with tatties and neeps begins.[DOC] [TLE] The Burns Night Face-Off: Haggis versus the Big Mac!

[PAR] From the White Christmas page, Steven Lewis' The Bing Crosby Internet Museum (excerpt, abridged) [PAR] \" [PAR] White Christmas\" was written in 1940 by a Irving Berlin for the 1942 movie \"Holiday Inn\" starring Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire. Berlin's assignment was to write a song about each of the major holidays of the year. But Berlin, who was Jewish, found that writing a song about Christmas was the most challenging. He drew upon his experiences of the holiday in New York (including Christmas Trees erected by neighbors when he was a boy) and Los Angeles, but still felt that the end result was wanting. However, when Bing first heard Berlin audition \"White Christmas\" in 1941 he reassured Irving that he had created a winner. Bing's preliminary evaluation turned out to be a gross understatement. [PAR] Bing Crosby introduced \"White Christmas\" to the public on his NBC radio show, the Kraft Music Hall, December 25, 1941. Apparently, no recording of this broadcast survived the War. He then recorded the song for Decca on May 29, 1942, with the John Scott Trotter Orchestra. \"Holiday Inn\" was released in August, 1942. [PAR] By the end of the War it had become the biggest-selling single of all time. Bing's recording hit the charts on Oct. 3, 1942, and rose to #1 on Oct. 31, where it stayed for an amazing 11 weeks. In the following years Bing's recording hit the top 30 pop charts another 16 times, even topping the charts again in 1945 and January of '47. The song remains Bing's best-selling recording, and the best-selling Christmas single of all-time. [PAR] The success of the song led eventually to a movie based on the song. The movie \"White Christmas\" was released in 1954 and became the leading box-office draw of 1954. The movie was supposed to reunite Crosby and Astaire for their third Irving Berlin extravaganza of song and dance. However, Astaire bowed out after reading the script (another source says that Astaire was ill at the time). Donald O'Connor was selected to replace Astaire, but he, too, had to exit because of a back injury. O'Connor was replaced by Danny Kaye. [PAR] Bing's single of \"White Christmas\" sold more than 30 million copies worldwide and was recognized as the best-selling single in any music category for more than 50 years until 1998 when Elton John's tribute to Princess Diana, \"Candle in the Wind,\" overtook it in a matter of months. However, Bing's recording of \"White Christmas\" has sold additional millions of copies as part of numerous albums, including his best-selling album \"Merry Christmas\", which was first released as an L.P. in 1949. [PAR] The most familiar version of \"White Christmas\" is not the one Crosby recorded in 1942, however. Bing was called back to the Decca studios on March 19, 1947, to re-record \"White Christmas\" as a result of damage to\n\n\n### Answer:\nholiday inn </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood), Hawk Hawkins (Tommy Lee Jones), Jerry O'Neill (Donald Sutherland), and Tank Sullivan (James Garner) were top pilots within an elite Air Force squadron and on the fast track to becoming the first Americans in space in the early 1950s. However, when NASA was established, the pilots were cut out of the loop; Corvin went on to become an aerospace engineer, Hawkins continued on as a freelance pilot, O'Neill became an astrophysicist with a sideline in designing roller coasters, and Sullivan took up preaching as a Baptist minister. Years later, a Russian satellite's guidance system has started to malfunction, and it is expected to crash into the Earth within a matter of weeks. The system is identical to the one Corvin designed for Skylab, so NASA head Bob Gerson (James Cromwell) asks Corvin to help him with the emergency mission to repair the satellite. Corvin agrees under one condition -- that he be sent up to do the repairs himself, with Hawkins, O'Neill, and Sullivan as his crew. Clint Eastwood directed Space Cowboys while also starring as Frank Corvin; his supporting cast includes Marcia Gay Harden, Courtney B. Vance, Loren Dean, and William Devane. [PAR] Advertising [PAR] Editorial Reviews [PAR] Barnes & Noble  - Ed Hulse [PAR] A quartet of aging but still popular stars strut their stuff in Space Cowboys, a rollicking adventure film that delivers a playful poke in the eye to youth-obsessed Hollywood. Clint Eastwood , Tommy Lee Jones , James Garner , and Donald Sutherland -- representing 150 combined years of experience in front of the camera -- play retired Air Force men who washed out of America\u2019s space program four decades earlier. Their collective expertise in now-obsolete computer technology suddenly makes these geriatric flyers invaluable: Repairs are desperately needed on a failing, missile-loaded Russian satellite, and the old-timers are launched into space to do what the younger astronauts can\u2019t. Eastwood, who also directs, depicts the space program\u2019s training regimen with a documentarian's fidelity and elicits laughs by showing himself and his costars huffing their ways through its rigors. The film\u2019s character-driven script provides each of the veteran stars with pithy dialogue and scene-stealing moments, and their spirited interplay is even more entertaining than the mission itself. There\u2019s no shortage of action, thrills, or suspense, but Space Cowboys is also warmly humorous, wistful, and elegiac, and thus ranks among Eastwood\u2019s best movies. DVD supplements include behind-the-scenes footage, documentaries (covering both the film\u2019s production and NASA\u2019s operations), theatrical trailers, special DVD-ROM content, and web access. [PAR] All Movie Guide  - Karl Williams [PAR] An unusually populist comedy for a director of such normally refined tastes, this geriatric space adventure from Clint Eastwood spoofs the aging of the Baby Boomer generation with broad appeal, but flags in its poorly structured third act. While Space Cowboys gets off to an interesting start in a flashback sequence that casts lookalike actors with their voices dubbed by the film's stars, the story's central conceit (four aging would-be astronauts getting one last chance to blast off) is exhaustively rehashed, making for a tiring set-up. Once the quartet of creaking seniors is in training for their mission, however, the film finds its legs and purpose, sending up the idea of vitamin-popping oldsters rediscovering their right stuff with zeal and relish. When its characters finally achieve orbit, the film loses its way again, stumbling with a subplot involving an egotistical young colleague who botches a job and the unexpected illness of a central figure. Nevertheless, Space Cowboys is about two-thirds of a fine and enjoyably risible comedy that is a bounce back for Eastwood after stumbling badly with his last directorial effort, True Crime\n\n\n### Answer:\nspace cowboys </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

But its mix of A-list guests, the hottest bands, filmed stories and studio stunts got people talking about it more than any other \"youth\" show before it. [PAR] Loathed by many, especially the press, the show's defining moments arose from its choice of live music and its dozens of innovative items \u2013 Oliver Reed being secretly filmed drinking in his dressing room, Lynne Perrie doing her own special (and lubricated) version of I Will Survive after being sacked from Coronation Street, a strand called The Hopefuls in which viewers came on and did unpleasant things such as snogging an old woman, because, as they said: \"I'd do anything to get on television.\" [PAR] In this post-Big Brother and X\u00a0Factor world it is hard to imagine now how revolutionary the show was, but in 1990 multichannel TV had hardly started, the independent television production sector was tiny, and the most risque show on TV was Blind Date. People used to go to bed at 11pm, even on Fridays. It was only when Michael Grade , then chief executive of Channel 4, changed the Word's transmission time from 6pm to 11pm a few weeks after it began that the programme became essential post-pub fodder, and it changed viewing habits\u00a0for ever.

This exceeds even the gestation period of whales, which ranges from 10 to 18 months, depending on the species. The record for the shortest gestation of any mammal belongs to the Virginia opossum, which gives birth after a mere 12 days, after which the offspring spends several months living in the mother's pouch.[DOC] [TLE] What Animals Stay Pregnant for a Long Time? - mom.meWhat Animals Stay Pregnant for a Long Time? | Animals - mom.me [PAR] What Animals Stay Pregnant for a Long Time? [PAR] An elephant will never forget her two-year pregnancy. [PAR] Anup Shah/Digital Vision/Getty Images [PAR] Nine months can feel like an eternity to a pregnant woman, but 266 days is short compared to the longer gestation periods that many animals go through. For most species, the gestation period typically runs from conception until birth. The length of the gestation period for many animals is determined by the size of their species. Smaller species of animals generally have a shorter gestation period than bigger animals. In some instances, longer gestation periods can be found among more developed species. [PAR] The Longest Wait [PAR] Elephants are social animals with a high degree of intelligence similar to dolphins and great apes. These gentle giants have the longest gestation period of all mammals, carrying their developing babies for nearly two years before giving birth. Because elephants are the largest land animal in the world with the biggest brains, their long gestation period allows for proper development of the fetus in the womb. After the gestation period, a single elephant calf is born that weights about 265 pounds. While female elephants can live up to 70 years, they generally only give birth to four babies during their lifetime. [PAR] 16 Months of Patience [PAR] The white rhino is one of the largest of all rhino species, so it's not surprising that her large stature would lead to a long gestation period of 15 to 16 months. After the gestation period, the mother gives birth to a single calf weighing around 143 pounds. Female rhinos typically give birth to one calf at intervals of every two to three years. A calf will remain with her mother for around two to four years until the next offspring is born. All five species of rhinoceros are considered either critically endangered or vulnerable to being endangered, including the white rhino. Their long and slow gestation period is an obstacle to repopulating the species. [PAR] The 14-Month Hump [PAR] Native to areas of the Middle East, northern India and arid Africa, the camel has evolved to survive in the desert and can go without water for up to three weeks. They are often referred to as \u201cships of the desert\" because these sturdy creatures have served to transport humans and cargo across long distances throughout history. Camels are considered to be ill-tempered with stubborn personalities, even biting, spitting and kicking humans. Their long gestation periods of 13 to 14 months might contribute to their grumpiness. After the gestation period, they give birth to a single calf. [PAR] Finally Falling Out [PAR] With a gestation period of 15 to 16 months, the giraffe has one of the longest gestation periods in the animal kingdom. Known for being the tallest terrestrial animal in the world, the mother gives birth while standing up. The baby calf emerges with her front legs and head first and then falls to the ground, which serves to sever the umbilical cord.

He was created, operated and voiced by David Claridge, who had previously been behind the Mooncat puppet in the Children's ITV television programme Get Up and Go! David worked for Jim Henson, then the second series of The Young Ones. He would later operate and voice \"Brian the Dinosaur\" for BBC's Parallel 9 Create and direct 'Happy Monsters' a pre school series for Channel 5 and shoot a CG series 'Mozart's Dog' for Paramount Comedy. [PAR] Roland lived beneath King's Cross railway station in The Ratcave. He has an infant brother called Little Reggie, and had a girlfriend: Glenis the Guinea Pig. His colleagues included dour Welsh technical whizz Errol the Hamster, and over-enthusiastic self-appointed \"number one ratfan\" Kevin the Gerbil, who supposedly came from Leeds and loved pink buckets. Claridge actually voiced all three main characters: Roland Rat, Errol the Hamster and Kevin The Gerbil; and they often appeared on screen together. Roland Rat's car 'the Ratmobile' is a bright pink 1953 Ford Anglia. [PAR] Roland Rat was introduced to ailing breakfast television network TV-am by Anne Wood and was generally regarded as its saviour, being described as \"the only rat to join a sinking ship\". After a couple of months on TV-am, Roland took the audience from 100,000 to 1.8 million. One notable highlight during this period was the visit of the late Austrian racing driver Roland Ratzenberger who appeared on the show in a motor race against the Ratmobile ending with Ratzenberger's car[1] being sabotaged by his near-namesake. Between 1983 and 1985, Roland had three UK chart hit singles including \"Rat Rapping\" and an album The Cassette Of The Album. An LP version of the recording, The Album Of The Cassette was released concurrently. The cassette recording claimed to be the LP recording, and vice versa. Each of the main characters contributed a song: Kevin the Gerbil's were My Rowland and Pink Bucket Reggae, Reggie's song was It's great here, innit, and Errol the Hamster contributed Leeks Are Wonderful, Leeks Are Nice. A follow-up LP, Living Legend was produced by Stock Aitken Waterman. Kevin the Gerbil also had a top 50 single. [PAR] Arguably Roland Rat's golden age was his Christmas show Roland Rat's Winter Wonderland in 1984. TV-AM sold Roland Rat advent calendars, with Roland opening each door with the viewers at 7.20am every day. The final show had Roland and his chums in the snow. The following year at Easter, Roland Rat hosted the show Roland Rat in Kowloon, Hong Kong. [PAR] In 1985 he transferred to the BBC where he had a number of shows through the late 1980s, most notably Roland Rat the Series, a chat show set in Roland's sewer home, now converted into a high-tech media centre the Ratcave.

If you can write equally well with either hand, then you are the one percent . Even among the small population of \u2018multi-handed\u2019 individuals, very few experience equal ease and skill with both hands. In comparison, around 10% of people are lefties. [PAR] 2. Right-, left- and mixed-handedness aren\u2019t sufficient to define the preferences of most people, according to experts. Most people experience some level of cross-dominance \u2014 favoring one hand for certain tasks, even if it\u2019s the non-dominant one \u2014 and among the group of people who use both hands, there are even finer distinctions. Ambidextral refers to those who can use both hands as well as a right-hander\u2019s right hand (so, really well), and ambisinistral can be used to describe people who use both hands as well as a right-hander\u2019s left hand (that is, somewhat clumsily). [PAR] 3. Unlike righties, who show strong left brain dominance, the hemispheres of ambidextrous and left-handed people\u2019s brains are almost symmetric... [PAR] 4. ... as is the typical brain of a person with synesthesia, or \u201cmixed senses,\u201d who experiences cross-sensory perception. Among synesthetes, the instance of ambidexterity (and left-handedness) is much higher than in the general population. [PAR] 5. The ambidextrous are more likely to possess the LRRTM1 gene (on chromosome 2), which is linked to schizophrenia. Studies reveal that people with schizophrenia are significantly more likely to be ambidextrous or left-handed than people who are not schizophrenic. [PAR] 6. Another study, conducted through the BBC Science website, shows that of the one percent of 255,000 respondents who indicated equal ease writing with both hands, 9.2% of men and 15.6% of women reported being bisexual . In the same study, 4% of right-handed and 4.5% of left-handed men, and 6.2% of right-handed and 6.3% of left-handed women said they\u2019re attracted to both sexes. [PAR] 7. People who identify as \u2018either-handed\u2019 score slightly lower overall in general intelligence testing, and most often those scores are lower in arithmetic, memory and reasoning... [PAR] 8. ... except when they aren\u2019t. A study of 8000 children ages 7 and 8 shows that the 87 mixed-handed students had more pronounced difficulties in language skills, and at ages 15 and 16, the same students showed a higher risk of ADHD symptoms and performed academically under both right- and left-handed students from the same sample. [PAR] 9. Ambis can be quick to anger, according to a study from Merrimack College, which suggests a higher interlinking of brain hemispheres found in ambidextrous and lefties. A follow-up study found that the increased hemisphere connections correlate to increased awkwardness, clumsiness and moodiness. [PAR] 10. But inconsistent-handers can also be easier to sway emotionally . Montclair State University tested a group of right- left and either-handers for emotional stability. Their findings report that of the group, righties were hardest to coerce, and ambis were most likely to report a change in mood based on their surroundings, directed thought, and music. [PAR] 11. It\u2019s not all bad news for the handedness-ambivalent, though. Being able to use both hands with (almost) equal ease can really pay off, especially in sports, arts and music. Some reportedly cross-dominant celebrities and historic figures include Leonardo da Vinci, Pete Rose, Richard Feynmen, pitcher Greg A. Harris, Michelle Kwan, Shigeru Miyamoto, Paul McCartney, Benjamin Franklin and Harry Truman.[DOC] [TLE] What's the single-word for \"left or right handed\"?hypernyms - What's the single-word for \"left or right handed\"? - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange [PAR] up vote 11 down vote accepted [PAR] Another option would be hand-dominance or hand-dominancy as a single word.

St David is the patron saint of Wales, St Andrew of Scotland and St Patrick of Ireland - St George being the patron saint of England. [PAR] But who was St. George, and what did he do to become England\u2019s Patron Saint? [PAR] Very little is known about St. George\u2019s life, but it is thought he was a high ranking officer in the Roman army who was killed in around AD 303. [PAR] It seems that the Emperor Diocletian had St. George tortured to make him deny his faith in Christ. However despite some of the most terrible torture even for that time, St George showed incredible courage and faith and was finally beheaded near Lydda in Palestine. His head was later taken to Rome where it was interred in the church dedicated to him. [PAR] Stories of his strength and courage soon spread throughout Europe. The best-known story about St. George is his fight with a dragon, but it is highly unlikely that he ever fought a dragon, and even more unlikely that he ever visited England, however his name was known there as early as the eighth-century. [PAR] In the Middle Ages the dragon was commonly used to represent the Devil. Unfortunately the many legends connected with St. George\u2019s name are fictitious, and the slaying of the \u2018Dragon\u2019 was first credited to him in the 12th century. [PAR] St. George, so the story goes, killed a dragon on the flat topped Dragon Hill in Uffington, Berkshire, and it is said that no grass grows where the dragon\u2019s blood trickled down! [PAR] It was probably the 12th century Crusaders however who first invoked his name as an aid in battle. [PAR] King Edward III made him the Patron Saint of England when he formed the Order of the Garter in St. George's name in 1350, and the cult of the Saint was further advanced by King Henry V , at the battle of Agincourt in northern France. [PAR] Shakespeare made sure that nobody would forget St. George, and has King Henry V finishing his pre-battle speech with the famous phrase, \u2018Cry God for Harry, England and St. George!\u2019 [PAR] King Henry himself, who was both warlike and devout, was thought by his followers to possess many of the saint\u2019s characteristics. [PAR] The Tomb of St George, Lod, Israel [PAR] In England St. George\u2019s Day is celebrated, and his flag flown, on his feast day, April 23rd. [PAR] An interesting piece of trivia - Shakespeare was born on St. George\u2019s Day 1564, and if the story is to be believed, died on St. George\u2019s Day 1616. [PAR] An appropriate end perhaps for the man who helped to immortalise the Saint in English tradition. [PAR] \u00a0[DOC] [TLE] Saint GeorgeSaint George ( Ge\u1e53rgios; ;  to 23 April 303), according to legend, was a Roman soldier and officer in the Guard of Roman emperor Diocletian of the Roman army, who ordered his death for failing to recant his Christian faith. As a Christian martyr, he later became one of the most venerated saints in Christianity. [PAR] In hagiography, as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers and one of the most prominent military saints, he is immortalised in the myth of Saint George and the Dragon. His memorial, Saint George's Day, is traditionally celebrated on the Julian date of April 23 (currently May 6 according to the Gregorian calendar). Numerous countries, cities, professions and organisations claim Saint George as their patron. [PAR] According to some sources his parents were Christians of the noble Roman family of the gens Anicia.  Other sources say his parents were Christians of Greek background; his father Gerontius ( Gerontios) was a Roman army official from Cappadocia, and his mother Polychronia was a Christian and a Greek native  from Lydda in the Roman province of Syria Palaestina (Palestine).

The song evolved from a single cartoon cell conceived of the feline character featured in the opening credits, and Mancini only provided a tempo to the animators, rather than a complete score as was usual in the business. The accents of the brass section and the now-famous \"dead ant\" cadence had an immediate appeal to moviegoers, while jazz musician Plas Johnson was specifically recruited by Mancini for the now-legendary tenor sax solo. Mancini quickly realized that the music was also perfect for the jewel thief's character in the film (played by David Niven ), so the opening music became the recurring theme throughout the movie. Mancini 's recording is easily the most widely known, though a jazz treatment recorded by alto sax great Phil Woods with trumpeter Carl Saunders merits attention as well.

The title track became one of his most recognizable themes and kicks off a pleasant program of dreamy lounge cuts and Latin-tinged numbers. As he did on many other movie/TV albums (Touch of Evil, Peter Gunn , etc.), Mancini also includes some noirish, big band numbers, like \"The Tiber Twist\" and the main title. Along with these up-tempo songs, he balances out the mostly light material with the solidly swinging mambos \"The Village Inn,\" \"Something for Sellers\" (as in Peter Sellers, the movies' star), and \"It Had Better Be Tonight\" (co-written by frequent partner Johnny Mercer and something of a minor vocal hit upon its release).

One of its secrets was keeping good relations with  China, something the Thais had succeeded in doing since the Nan Zhao era. After  1767 Siam's rulers were part Chinese themselves, which also encouraged this  trend. Large numbers of Chinese immigrants came into the country; by 1850 there  were 350,000 of them living in Siam. Gradually they gained control of the  economy as bankers, managers of public works, and tax collectors; they were also  the only Siamese citizens allowed to sell opium legally. When the Dutch East  India Company collapsed, the Chinese merchants stepped in to take the Company's  place, dominating Southeast Asia's seaborne trade. Before 1850 there was a  shortage of women among the Chinese immigrants, so many of them intermarried  into Thai families, further blurring ethnic differences. [PAR] The first three kings of the Chakri dynasty were mainly interested in  restoration. Law codes, religious texts, and works of literature were rewritten.  New temples and palaces were built using the patterns, and even the very bricks,  of old Ayutthaya. Chakri Rama I (1782-1809) defeated five Burmese invasions,  annexed two Cambodian provinces (Battambang and Siem Reap) and reestablished the  court rituals of the Ayutthayan era. The next king, Phendin-Klang Rama II  (1809-24), was an outstanding poet, producing Thai translations of the Hindu Ramayana and other classical Asian works with a team of court poets. P'ra  Nang Klao Rama III (1824-51) put down a rebellion in Laos and made protectorates  of four northern Malay states (Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan and Trengganu). In  Cambodia he fought several inconclusive campaigns to stop Vietnamese expansion  (1833-45); an 1846 treaty made Cambodia a tributary state of both Siam and  Vietnam. [PAR] Officially Siam had been an isolationist state since the Phaulkon episode in  the late 17th century, and the Chinese merchants encouraged this policy to keep  competition out. But eventually the West was able to pry open the closed doors  of Siam anyway. Treaties signed with Britain in 1826 and the United States in  1833 allowed Protestant missionaries and a small amount of trade into the  country. More important was a treaty signed with Britain in 1855, which gave the  following to the UK: extraterritoriality, most-favored-nation status, a  consulate in Bangkok, and a maximum tariff of 3% on British goods. It also gave  Britons the right to sell Siamese goods, lease land, build homes, and travel one  day's distance from Bangkok. Before long France and the other Western powers  stepped in and demanded similar trade agreements; the king, Mongkut Rama IV  (1851-68), agreed to them all, seeing rivalry between foreign powers as the best  way to keep one of them from gaining too much influence over his country. [PAR] Nobody supported the opening up of Siam with more enthusiasm than the king  himself. He had been eligible for the throne as early as 1824, but his father,  Rama II, placed him in a monastery, presumably to keep him safe from supporters  of his elder, more popular brother, the future king Rama III. The old king died  only three weeks later, and Rama III was crowned without opposition. [PAR] Mongkut was not idle during his brother's 27-year reign. He tried to be a  good monk, but the more he learned about Buddhism, the more he was bothered by  the current state of Buddhism in Siam. Monks and lay people alike, he concluded,  had blindly followed traditions without thorough knowledge of the original  texts. On careful study of texts regarding ordinations of monks, Mongkut was  upset to find that modern Siamese ordinations were invalid. He responded by  creating his own order of monks, reforming their daily practices, rituals,  preaching and even their pronunciation\n\n\n### Answer:\nthailand </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

The pilot of the single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza was also killed. Holly hired the plane after heating problems developed on his tour bus. All three were traveling to Fargo, North Dakota, for the next show on their Winter Dance Party Tour which Holly had planned to make money after the break-up of his band, The Crickets, in the previous year. [PAR] The Winter Dance Party Tour was planned to cover 24 cities in just three weeks and Holly would be the biggest headliner. Waylon Jennings, a friend from Lubbock, Texas, and Tommy Allsup joined the tour as backup musicians. Ritchie Valens, probably the hottest of the artists at the time, The Big Bopper, and Dion and the Belmonts made up the list of other performers. [PAR] The grueling tour schedule had taken the acts to the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa the previous night. Due to mechanical difficulty with their chartered bus, the group arrived at Surf Ballroom less than two hours before the performance. The ballroom was packed with over 1500 fans, many of whom had driven hundreds of miles on snow-covered roads to see the stars perform. [PAR] Buddy was fed up with the chartered bus with its faulty heater, so before the performance he asked the Surf manager Carroll Anderson about renting a chartered plane to fly him to his next destination in Moorhead, Minnesota. Anderson knew the owner of Dwyer Flying Service in nearby Mason City whom he contacted to arrange the flight. Anderson was not able to get hold of the owner so he called one of the pilots, Roger Peterson, who agreed to take Buddy plus two others to Moorhead. [PAR] After the performance, the group got ready to travel to their next show on the tour bus. Holly boarded the 1947 Beechcraft Bonanza aircraft to Fargo, North Dakota, the nearest airport to Moorhead. Two other members of the group had the option to fly with him at $36 per person. Dion didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt want to pay, but Waylon Jennings was keen to fly with Buddy, but exchanged his seat with J.P. Richardson because he had a cold. Tommy Allsup was included in the group, but Ritchie Valens offered to flip him for the seat since he was ill. The local host of the Winter Dance Party, Bob Hale, flipped the coin. Ritchie called heads and won the toss. Years later, Tommy Alsup would open a dance club named the Heads Up Saloon to commemorate this life-saving coin toss. [PAR] In his 1996 autobiography, Waylon Jennings stated that he was disappointed that he had to ride in the freezing bus, so his parting remark to Buddy was, \"I hope your damn plane crashes!\" Jennings said this remark has haunted him ever since then. [PAR] The plane took off around 1:00 AM from Mason City Airport into a blinding snowstorm and crashed only minutes later in a cornfield, killing all three musicians and the pilot. Because the plane didn't catch fire when it crashed, no one noticed the wreckage until the next day, about a quarter mile from the nearest country road. [PAR] Early reports from the scene suggest the aircraft spun out of control during a light snowstorm. Only the pilot's body was found inside the wreckage as the performers were thrown clear on impact. [PAR] The Civil Aeronautics Board concluded that the primary cause of the crash was pilot error due to the 21-year-old Peterson's inability to accurately interpret the newly installed Sperry F3 attitude indicator, which he was forced to rely upon in the poor weather conditions. The theory was that Peterson may have read the gyroscope backwards as a result of vertigo and thought that the plane was gaining altitude when it was actually descending. [PAR] Buddy Holly\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds body was buried a few days later on 7 February.

[PAR] A: [PAR] Quick Answer [PAR] There are four kings in a standard deck of playing cards. One king belongs to each of the four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. [PAR] Full Answer [PAR] The king is the highest ranking of the three face card types. After the king comes the queen and then the jack. In most games, the ace is the highest ranking card and the only card ranked above a king. A standard deck of cards contains 52 total cards that are divided evenly among the four suits. In addition to the face cards and the aces, there are cards in each suit for the numbers two through ten.[DOC] [TLE] Playing cardA playing card is a piece of specially prepared heavy paper, thin cardboard, plastic-coated paper, cotton-paper blend, or thin plastic, marked with distinguishing motifs and used as one of a set for playing card games. Playing cards are typically palm-sized for convenient handling. [PAR] A complete set of cards is called a pack (UK English), deck (US English), or set (Universal), and the subset of cards held at one time by a player during a game is commonly called a hand. A pack of cards may be used for playing a variety of card games, with varying elements of skill and chance, some of which are played for money (e.g., poker and blackjack games at a casino). Playing cards are also used for illusions, cardistry, building card structures, cartomancy and memory sport. [PAR] The front (or \"face\") of each card carries markings that distinguish it from the other cards in the pack and determine its use under the rules of the game being played. The back of each card is identical for all cards in any particular pack to create an imperfect information scenario. Usually every card will be smooth; however, some packs have braille to allow blind people to read the card number and suit. [PAR] Dedicated deck card games have sets that are used only for a specific game. The cards described in this article are used for many games and share a common origin stemming from the standards set in Mamluk Egypt. These sets divide their cards into four suits each consisting of three face cards and numbered or \"pip\" cards. [PAR] History [PAR] Early history [PAR] The scholarly consensus is that playing cards were invented in Imperial China.  They first appeared as early as 9th century Tang China (618\u2013907).    The first reference to card games also dates from the 9th century, when the Collection of Miscellanea at Duyang, written by Tang dynasty writer Su E, described Princess Tongchang, daughter of Emperor Yizong of Tang, playing the \"leaf game\" in 868 with members of the Wei clan, the family of the princess' husband.   The first known book on the \"leaf\" game was called the Yezi Gexi and was allegedly written by a Tang woman, and was commented on by Chinese writers of subsequent dynasties. The Song dynasty (960\u20131279) scholar Ouyang Xiu (1007\u20131072) asserted that the \"leaf\" game existed at least since the mid-Tang dynasty and associated their invention with the simultaneous development of using sheets or pages instead of paper rolls as a writing medium.   However, Ouyang claimed the \"leaves\" were pages of a book for a board game played with dice.  In any case, Ouyang asserted that the rules for the game were lost by 1067. [PAR] It may be that the first pack of cards ever printed was a 32-card Chinese domino pack, in whose cards all 21 combinations of a pair of dice are depicted. According to the Gui Tian Lu (\u6b78\u7530\u9304), an 11th-century Chinese text redacted, domino cards were printed during the Tang dynasty, contemporary to the first printed books. There is difficulty distinguishing paper cards and gaming tiles in many early sources as the Chinese word p\u00e1i (\u724c) is used to describe both.

[PAR] The son of a pastor, brought  up in a religious and cultured atmosphere, Vincent was highly emotional, lacked self-confidence and struggled with his identity and with direction. He believed that his true calling was to preach the gospel; however, it took years for him to discover his calling as an artist. Between 1860 and 1880, when he  finally decided to become an artist, van Gogh had already experienced two unsuitable and unhappy romances and had worked unsuccessfully as a clerk  in a bookstore, an art salesman, and a preacher in the Borinage (a dreary mining district in Belgium) where he was dismissed for  overzealousness. [PAR] He remained in Belgium to study art, determined to give happiness by creating beauty. The works of his early Dutch  period are somber-toned, sharply lit, genre paintings of which the most famous is \"The Potato Eaters\" (1885). In that year van Gogh went  to Antwerp where he discovered the works of Rubens and  purchased many Japanese prints . [PAR] In 1886, he went to Paris to join his brother Th\u00e9o, the manager of Goupil's gallery. In Paris, van Gogh studied with Cormon, inevitably met Pissarro , Monet , and Gauguin . Having met the new Impressionist painters, he tried to imitate their techniques; he began to lighten his very dark palette and to paint in the short brushstrokes of the Impressionists\u2019 style. Unable to successfully copy the style, he developed his own more bold and unconventional style. [PAR] In 1888, Van Gogh decided to go south to Arles where he hoped his friends would join him and help found a school of art. At The Yellow House , van Gogh hoped like-minded artists could create together. Gauguin did join him but with disastrous results. Van Gogh\u2019s nervous temperament made him a difficult companion and night-long discussions combined with painting all day undermined his health . Near the end of 1888, an incident led Gauguin to ultimately leave Arles. Van Gogh pursued him with an open razor, was stopped by Gauguin, but ended up cutting a portion of his own ear lobe off. Van Gogh then began to alternate between fits of madness and lucidity and was sent to the asylum in Saint-Remy for treatment. [PAR] Self Portraits of Vincent van Gogh [PAR] In May of 1890, after a couple of years at the asylum, he seemed much better and went to live in Auvers-sur-Oise under the watchful eye of Dr. Gachet . Two months later, he died from what is believed to have been a self-inflicted gunshot wound \"for the good of all.\" During his brief career, he did not experience much success, he sold only one painting, lived in poverty, malnourished and overworked. The money he had was supplied by his brother, Theo, and was used primarily for art supplies, coffee and cigarettes. [PAR] Van Gogh's finest works were produced in less than three years in a technique that grew more and more impassioned in brushstroke, in symbolic and intense color, in surface tension, and in the movement and vibration of form and line. Van Gogh's inimitable fusion of form and content is powerful; dramatic, lyrically rhythmic, imaginative, and emotional, for the artist was completely absorbed in\n\n\n### Answer:\ndutch </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Like the ubiquitous creatures at the heart of the plot, Gremlins delights in mayhem. The proud owner of a restless spirit and a tendency to rattle the gearbox at the slightest hint of a lull, the film can be splendidly unpredictable, charmingly sweet and morbidly profane, sometimes all within the same scene. It's vividly violent, often shockingly so, but still touts a wild sense of humor and an unexpected knack for sentimentality. I was pleasantly surprised at the lengths it was willing to go to, considering no member of the cast indispensable, and that left me hooked right up until the closing showdown.

Novelty songs, charity songs or songs with a Christmas theme have regularly been at the top of Christmas charts.  Traditionally the volume of record sales in the UK peaks at Christmas,  with the Christmas number one being considered especially prestigious, more so than any other time of year.    Many of the Christmas number ones were also the best-selling song of the year. Due to the common practice of dating a chart by the date on which the week ends, the Christmas chart is dated the end of the week containing 25 December, but comprises sales for the week before that. The most recent Christmas number one single is \"A Bridge over You\" by the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Choir.  [PAR] History [PAR] The official UK Singles Chart began in 1952 after appearing in the New Musical Express;  the positions of all songs are based on week end sale totals (from Sunday to Saturday until 2015, then from Friday to Thursday).  Before 1987 they were released on a Tuesday due to the need for manual calculation.  The emergence of a serious contest for the Christmas number-one spot began in 1973 when the band Slade deliberately released \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" as an effort to reach the top of the charts on Christmas.   [PAR] Since 2002 the Christmas number one has been dominated by reality television contests, with the winners often heading straight to number one in the week before Christmas. This trend began when Popstars: The Rivals contestants released the top three singles on the Christmas chart.  From 2005 to 2008, 2010 and 2013 to 2014, the winners of The X Factor took the number-one spot on eight occasions. In 2007, the X Factor single was so much of a prohibitive favourite for number one that bookmakers started taking bets on which song would be the \"Christmas Number Two\" instead.  [PAR] Rage Against the Machine's 1992 single \"Killing in the Name\" outsold Joe McElderry in 2009 following a successful Facebook campaign.   This made them the first group to get a Christmas number one with a download-only single, and resulted in the most download sales in a single week in UK chart history. Similar campaigns in 2010 promoting acts such as Biffy Clyro, John Cage and The Trashmen were unsuccessful.  The following year, participants from reality television show The Choir outsold X Factor winners Little Mix and a host of social network campaigns for various novelty acts,   and in 2012, a supergroup cover of \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\", supporting charities associated with the Hillsborough disaster, took the accolade ahead of The X Factors James Arthur.  Following the UK Charts' move to Fridays,  the 2015 Christmas number one was revealed on Christmas Day;   that year's chart was the first in a decade to not feature the X Factor winner's single in either first or second.   [PAR] Records [PAR] The Beatles are the only act to have four Christmas number ones, three consecutively starting from 1963. On two occasions, 1963 and 1967, they had both the Christmas number one and the number two, the only act to have achieved this. As part of two acts, George Michael repeated the feat with Band Aid and Wham! in 1984. Paul McCartney has been top eight times with various acts. Cliff Richard has spent four Christmasses at number one; two as a solo act, one with The Shadows and one as part of Band Aid II. The Spice Girls later equalled the record of having three consecutive Christmas number ones, from 1996 to 1998. Spice Girl Melanie C achieved a fourth Christmas number one as a member of The Justice Collective in 2012, which also gave Robbie Williams his third. [PAR] \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen, which reached the number-one spot at Christmas 1975 and 1991, is the only record to have reached the top twice. \"Mary's Boy Child\" is the only song to be Christmas number one for two entirely unrelated\n\n\n### Answer:\nfab four </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] Many Tennis fans would argue that Wimbledon is the toughest of the four majors to win as it is the only one played on a grass surface. The winner must therefore be versatile in handling the different challenges that playing on grass poses. Please check here for details of the 2010 Wimbledon mens seedings . [PAR] The 2011 Men\u2019s singles at Wimbledon promises yet again to be as exciting as ever with Roger Federer favourite in the Wimbledon mens singles betting to win the crown once again afre beating Andy Roddick last year. Nadal\u2019s victory in 2008 prevented Federer from becoming the first man in Wimbledon history to record six straight wins, he will be back at SW19 for the first time since and desperate to regain his crown. [PAR] In some media circles Federer was being written off last year, but he came back to the top when he won the US Open Tennis for the fifth straight year, defeating Britain's Andy Murray in the final. He then lost to Nadal in the Australian Open final in another five set epic, before achieving his greatest moment in tennis, when he won the French Open title for the first time. That win gave him a record equalling fourteen Grand Slams a record he shares with, Sampras and he also became the first man since Andre Agassi to win all four Grand Slam titles. [PAR] We think that Federer should win once more this year but the following players all have chances [PAR] Robin Soderling [PAR] Fred Perry - The last British Mens Single Champion [PAR] Fred Perry was the last British mens single champion at Wimbledon when he won the title for the third and final time in 1936. Perry, had won the previous two mens singles titles at the 1934 and 1935 Championship and despite being some years ago reports suggest that he was one of the greatest ever Wimbledon champions. Can Scot, Andy Murray emulate the great man this year? Murray has been in outstanding form this year and won the the title at Queens Club last week. He has shot up to number three in the world rankings and is third favourite to win in the mens singles betting. He reached the quarter finals last year where he was beaten by Rafa Nadal. Tim Henman remains the only British player to get to the semi finals in recent years, he achieved this four times in total. [PAR] Modern Era Mens Wimbledon Champions [PAR] In recent years, some of the biggest names in mens Tennis have lifted the famous Mens Singles trophy. Four times champion Rod Laver was the first male to claim the title in the open era in 1968 and 1969. Fellow Australian John Newcombe won back to back championships in 1970 and 1971 before Bjorn Borg won four consecutive titles between 1976 - 79. [PAR] During the 80s, the Wimbledon mens singles title was won by great names such as John McEnroe, Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg, all who won the title on more than one occasion during the decade. [PAR] American great Pete Sampras dominated the title in the 90s winning the mens singles crown a total of seven times between 1993 and 2000, only Richard Krajicek stopped him from winning a Wimbledon record eight straight titles.

Nectar and honey provide the energy for the bees\u2019 flight muscles and for heating the hive during the winter period. Honeybees also collect pollen which supplies protein for bee brood to grow. [PAR] Honey bees live in\u00a0colonies\u00a0that are often maintained, fed, and transported by beekeepers. Centuries of selective breeding by humans have created honey bees that produce far more honey than the colony needs. Beekeepers harvest the honey. Beekeepers provide a place for the colony to live and to store honey in. The modern beehive is made up of a series of square or rectangular boxes without tops or bottoms placed one on top of another. Inside the boxes, frames are hung in parallel, in which bees build up the wax honeycomb in which they both raise brood and store honey. Modern hives enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as the crop needs pollinating and allowing the beekeeper to charge for the pollination services they provide. [PAR] A colony generally contains one breeding female, or \u201cqueen\u201d; a few thousand males, or \u201cdrones\u201d; and a large population of sterile female \u201cworker\u201d bees. The population of a healthy hive in mid-summer can average between 40,000 and 80,000 bees. The workers cooperate to find food and use a pattern of \u201cdancing\u201d to communicate with each other. [PAR] The Queen Bee [PAR] The queen is the largest bee in the colony. Queens are developed from larvae selected by worker bees to become sexually mature. The queen develops more fully than sexually immature workers because she is given royal jelly, a secretion from glands on the heads of young workers, for an extended time. She develops in a specially-constructed queen cell, which is larger than the cells of normal brood comb, and is oriented vertically instead of horizontally. [PAR] She will emerge from her cell to mate in flight with approximately 13-18 drone (male) bees. During this mating, she receives several million sperm cells, which last her entire life span (from two to five years). In each hive or colony, there is only one adult, mated queen, who is the mother of the worker bees of the hive, although there are exceptions on occasion. [PAR] Although the name might imply it, a queen has no control over the hive. Her sole function is to serve as the reproducer; she is an \u201cegg laying machine.\u201d A good queen of quality stock, well reared with good nutrition and well mated, can lay up to 3,000 eggs per day during the spring build-up and live for two or more years. She lays her own weight in eggs every couple of hours and is continuously surrounded by young worker attendants, who meet her every need, such as feeding and cleaning. [PAR] Worker Bees [PAR] A\u00a0worker bee\u00a0is a non-reproducing female which performs certain tasks in support of a bee hive. Worker bees undergo a well defined progression of capabilities. In the summer 98% of the bees in a hive are worker bees. In the winter, besides the queen, all bees are worker bees. Workers feed the queen and larvae, guard the hive entrance and help to keep the hive cool by fanning their wings. Worker bees also collect nectar to make honey. In addition, honey bees produce wax comb.[DOC] [TLE] Honey Bee - Fairfax County Public SchoolsHoney Bee [PAR] Honey Bee [PAR] Apis mellifera [PAR] Copyright, Mark Cassino [PAR] Honey Bees are an animal          most of us learn about very early on, one way or another.

[PAR] Childhood:\u00a0Liz Hurley was born in Basingstoke; the middle child of Angela, a primary school teacher and Reg, a major in the British Army. [PAR] As a child, she wanted to become a dancer and studied dance and theatre at the London Studio Centre. [PAR] From Obscurity to the Spotlight:\u00a0Elizabeth Hurley met Hugh Grant in 1987 whilst she was working on a Spanish production called Remando Al Viento. They embarked upon what was to become a lengthy relationship. In 1994, she accompanied Grant to the premiere of his Four Weddings and a Funeral film, wearing a striking Versace dress that was held together down each side with outsized gold safety pins. It was this appearance that brought her to the attention of Est\u00e9e Lauder. [PAR] Her first modelling job, for Est\u00e9e Lauder, was at the age of 29. She has gone on to feature in many of their advertising campaigns. Although she was replaced as the face of the company in 2001, she has continued to model for them in a lesser role and in 2008 her contract was renewed for the 14th year. [PAR] Liz Hurley has also featured in ad campaigns for Monsoon, Lancel and Patrick Cox as well as having three Vogue cover shots to her name. She launched her own swimwear range, Elizabeth Hurley Beach in 2005 and in 2008, launched a range of 12 swimsuits for MANGO, the Spanish clothing label. [PAR] Film Career:\u00a0Hurley's first film appearance was in Aria in 1987. She went on to appear in a number of low-budget films but most notably, she appeared alongside Mike Myers in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery and Austin Powers: the Spy Who Shagged Me. Hurley's performances have never garnered much acclaim from critics and in 2000, she was nicknamed 'Elizabeth Scabley', for breaking a five month acting strike, to film an Est\u00e9e Lauder advert. She was fined \u00a370,000 by the Screen Actors' Guild. [PAR] Hurley is credited as an executive producer on two of the films released by Hugh Grant's own production company. Grant starred in both of the films, Mickey Blue Eyes and Extreme Measures. The company closed its US offices in 2002 and Grant legally resigned as director in 2005. [PAR] Television Work:\u00a0Liz Hurley was broadly criticised for her work on the Sky One reality show Project Catwalk. Not only did her presenting style come under scrutiny, but she was also criticised for asking contestants to send her free clothes, off the record. She was dropped after the first series of the show, after it achieved only 1% of its target audience. [PAR] Personal Life:\u00a0Hurley dated Hugh Grant between 1987 and 2000. In 1995, Hurley stood by Grant when he was arrested with a prostitute in Los Angeles. Five years later, they announced an 'amicable split'. [PAR] In April 2002, Hurley gave birth to Damian Charles, the son of the film producer Stephen Bing. Bing denied paternity until a DNA test proved that he is, indeed, Damian's father. Elizabeth Hurley is also godmother to Patsy Kensit's son Lennon. [PAR] In 2007, Liz Hurley married the Indian textile heir Arun Nayar. They were first married at Sudeley Castle, followed by a second, Hindu ceremony in Jodhpur, India.

[PAR] Reginald and Ronald Kray were notorious criminals whose  obsession with assaulting others, encouraging each other to greater levels of  violence, and extending their personal power and domination culminated in a  serious protection racket in London and a number of murders. Their blatant  violence and unstable mental condition, particularly of Ronald Kray, led to  intimidation of witnesses and the prospect of their escaping justice until they  were arrested and convicted by the efforts of a special squad of detectives led  by Detective Superintendent Leonard (\"Nipper\") Read. [PAR] The twins were born in 1933 and made their first appearance  at the Old Bailey in 1950, where the case of assault was dismissed for lack of  evidence. In 1952 they entered a period of National Service remarkable for their  violence, serious trouble with the military authorities and periods in custody.  After being released, they commenced a period of increasing control over  criminals, pubs and clubs in the East End of London. On 5th November  1956 Ronald Kray was jailed for 3 years for assaulting Terence Martin in a  gang-related incident, later became friends in Wandsworth prison with Frank  Mitchell and was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. His  violence worsened after his release.

They were assisted by a banker Alan Cooper who needed protection from  the rival Richardson gang from South London.

A gang war followed, and a Kray ally  Richard Hart was murdered at Mr Smith's club in Catford on 8th March  1966. Ronald Kray took revenge by killing George Cornell in The Blind Beggar  public house, Whitechapel Road. Intimidation prevented any witnesses from  cooperating with police.

He can, he claims, recite the opening lines of most of Dick Francis\u2019s 40-odd horse-racing thrillers. So far, I have failed miserably to catch him out. [PAR] He has, of course, a natural advantage. Dick was his father and writing the best-selling series of books, which appeared at the rate of one-a-year from 1962 until 2000, was something of a collective effort at the Francises\u2019 home, with the former champion jockey\u2019s wife, Mary, playing a key (though publicly unacknowledged) role in their production. [PAR] We are sitting in the bar of London\u2019s Goring Hotel, to discuss 58-year-old Felix Francis\u2019s first solo novel, Gamble, out next month. However, the shadow of his famous father, who died last year, is proving hard to escape. This place, for instance, had been Francis Senior\u2019s favourite home-from-home. It even boasts a \u201cDick Francis corner\u201d of books and memorabilia in one of its private dining rooms. [PAR] But then, arguably, Felix Francis isn\u2019t trying too hard. His own name may be there in big bold gold letters on the jacket of the book that lies on the table between us, but present, too, in only slightly smaller print, is the catchline \u201cA Dick Francis novel\u201d.

Though he is the first to raise the pragmatic marketing advantages of cloaking himself in his dead father\u2019s brand, he is also evidently sincere in his heartfelt wish to walk unashamedly in his shoes, turning on its head the conventional wisdom that every son wants to compete with his father and prove he can stand on his own two feet. For Felix, his dad\u2019s shadow is apparently not a burden but a blessing. [PAR] The common ground between Gamble and the Dick Francis back catalogue is extensive. For a start, Felix has set his book in the world of horse-racing. He has used many of his father\u2019s creative trademarks \u2013 including the first-person narrator and the amateur central character who finds himself inadvertently at the scene of the crime, but who proves more resourceful than the police in solving it. The writing, in true Francis style, is spare, efficient and unflashy, but inexorably draws you in. [PAR] Felix did, of course, serve an informal apprenticeship before taking over the literary reins. After the death of Mary Francis in 2000, he filled her co-authoring role on the next four Dick Francis books, albeit with a small print credit on the cover. \u201cMy father insisted on that,\u201d he says with an unmistakable pride.

They followed this campaign with their most successful qualifying attempt in their history during the 2018 World Cup qualifiers in summer 2015, winning twice and narrowly missing out on progressing to the next stage on goal difference. This rise in fortunes can be attributed to the increased number of US college based players, who experience a more professional training regime compared to the amateur players that used to dominate previous squads.

Soccer in Ecuador is something of a national pastime and local soccer heroes are celebrated with enthusiasm. In fact, the national soccer team has made waves all over the world, with Ecuador displaying some outstanding soccer talent that perhaps some parts of the world were completely unprepared to receive. In Ecuador, soccer is so popular that it is considered to be the national sport. Sometimes you will find locals playing more unusual games such as the \u201cpaddleball\u201d which is played in Ibarra. These two, can be joined in on, but it is a good idea to watch for a while first and learn the rules of the game. Many of the locals along the coast also enjoy a good game of volleyball. [PAR] Ecuador certainly has a wealth of sporting activities to partake in. Many of them require the hire of equipment or of a knowledgeable guide. You may also need someone to show you how to partake of the sport. You can be sure though, that any effort or expense is well worth it and that you will enjoy every moment of the activity you choose as it will be provided in a safe, well organized manner. [PAR] The most accessible activities are generally those that require very little equipment. Things such as walking, hiking and climbing \u2013 which is basically walking up to the peak of a mountain \u2013 are available just about everywhere in Ecuador. Of course, some of the more complex trails might require the services of a guide, but otherwise all you need is good health, a comfortable pair of shoes and a map. Sometimes tour operators will offer climbing tours wherein they will provide equipment, insurance, food and transport \u2013 basically all the facilities you will need to enjoy your climb in relative luxury. Most climbs take place up the sides of volcanoes to get you better acquainted with this natural phenomenon. Rainforest treks where you explore the fauna and flora of the Amazon basin are also popular. [PAR] Mountain bikes are readily available for hire throughout the country and often tourists will choose to bike between towns as this is an excellent way to really experience Ecuador. Water activities include swimming, whitewater rafting, snorkeling, kayaking, fishing, surfing, windsurfing and scuba diving \u2013 depending on what part of the country you are visiting. On the more extreme side of things, Bungee jumping, hang-gliding and Paragliding are also offered. Horseback riding and volleyball are two more popular choices. Mules and jeeps are available for hire as are yachts and rowing boats. [PAR] The Galapagos Islands themselves have a wealth of interesting activities to pursue, such as hiking, sea kayaking, snorkeling and scuba diving . The Galapagos Islands are part of a well protected nature reserve so it is best to remember to try not disturb any of the natural environment when visiting here. It is also a good idea to bring a camera or two \u2013 one for land and one for under water. There is such an abundance of wildlife here that you will not regret it. [PAR] If you are intent on pursuing any of these activities specifically, it would be prudent to ensure that they are being offered at your destination of choice.

Castor includes two extant species, the North American beaver (Castor canadensis) (native to North America) and Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) (Eurasia). Beavers are known for building dams, canals, and lodges (homes). They are the second-largest rodent in the world (after the capybara). Their colonies create one or more dams to provide still, deep water to protect against predators, and to float food and building material. The North American beaver population was once more than 60 million, but as of 1988 was 6\u201312 million. This population decline is the result of extensive hunting for fur, for glands used as medicine and perfume, and because the beavers' harvesting of trees and flooding of waterways may interfere with other land uses.  [PAR] General [PAR] Beavers, along with pocket gophers and kangaroo rats, are castorimorph rodents, a suborder of rodents mostly restricted to North America. Although just two closely related species exist today, beavers have a long fossil history in the Northern Hemisphere beginning in the Eocene, and many species of giant beaver existed until quite recently, such as Trogontherium in Europe, and Castoroides in North America. [PAR] Beavers are known for their natural trait of building dams on rivers and streams, and building their homes (known as \"lodges\") in the resulting pond. Beavers also build canals to float building materials that are difficult to haul over land.  They use powerful front teeth to cut trees and other plants that they use both for building and for food. In the absence of existing ponds, beavers must construct dams before building their lodges. First they place vertical poles, then fill between the poles with a crisscross of horizontally placed branches. They fill in the gaps between the branches with a combination of weeds and mud until the dam impounds sufficient water to surround the lodge. [PAR] They are known for their alarm signal: when startled or frightened, a swimming beaver will rapidly dive while forcefully slapping the water with its broad tail, audible over great distances above and below water. This serves as a warning to beavers in the area. Once a beaver has sounded the alarm, nearby beavers will dive and may not reemerge for some time. Beavers are slow on land, but are good swimmers, and can stay under water for as long as 15 minutes. [PAR] Beavers are herbivores, and prefer the wood of quaking aspen, cottonwood, willow, alder, birch, maple and cherry trees. They also eat sedges, pondweed, and water lilies.  [PAR] Beavers do not hibernate, but store sticks and logs in a pile in their ponds, eating the underbark. Some of the pile is generally above water and accumulates snow in the winter. This insulation of snow often keeps the water from freezing in and around the food pile, providing a location where beavers can breathe when outside their lodge. [PAR] Beavers have webbed hind-feet, and a broad, scaly tail. They have poor eyesight, but keen senses of hearing, smell, and touch. A beaver's teeth grow continuously so that they will not be worn down by chewing on wood. Their four incisors are composed of hard orange enamel on the front and a softer dentin on the back. The chisel-like ends of incisors are maintained by their self-sharpening wear pattern. The enamel in a beaver's incisors contains iron and is more resistant to acid than enamel in the teeth of other mammals. [PAR] Beavers continue to grow throughout their lives. Adult specimens weighing over 25 kg are not uncommon. Females are as large as or larger than males of the same age, which is uncommon among mammals. Beavers live up to 24 years of age in the wild. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The English word \"beaver\" comes from the Old English word beofor or befer (recorded earlier as bebr), which in turn sprang from the Proto-Germanic root *bebruz. Cognates in other Germanic languages include the Old Saxon bibar, the Old Norse bjorr, the Middle Dutch and Dutch bever, the Low German bever, the Old High German\n\n\n### Answer:\nlodges </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] From the Channel 4 website [PAR] Nelson - the dreaded score of 111. When this total is reached, the superstitious custom is for the batting team off the pitch (and umpire David Shepherd) to take their feet off the ground. The name was coined in the mistaken belief that Nelson had one eye, one arm and one leg: in fact, he had two legs.[DOC] [TLE] Nelson (cricket)Nelson is a piece of cricket slang terminology and superstition. [PAR] The name, applied to team or individual scores of 111 or multiples thereof (known as double nelson, triple nelson, etc.) is thought to refer to Lord Nelson's lost eye, arm and leg; however, notably Nelson actually had both of his legs intact, and the third missing body part is mythical.   Longtime cricket historian and scorer, Bill \"Bearders\" Frindall once referred to it online as \"one eye, one arm and one etcetera\", implying that Nelson's alleged third lost body part was \"something else\", however this is equally mythical. In the 1939 film of Goodbye, Mr Chips a schoolboy refers to Nelson in these terms: \"One arm, one eye, one destiny\". Umpire David Shepherd during a radio interview to mark his retirement explained it as \"One arm, one eye and one lump of sugar in his tea.\"   [PAR] It is thought by the superstitious that bad things happen on that score, although an investigation by the magazine The Cricketer in the 1990s found that wickets are no more likely to fall on Nelson and indeed, the score at which most wickets fall is 0 (a duck). It may be considered unlucky because the number resembles a wicket without bails  (a batsman is out if the bails are knocked off their wicket). [PAR] The New Zealand cricket team Nelson played first-class cricket from 1874 to 1891. In both their first  and last  first-class innings they were dismissed for 111. [PAR] David Shepherd made popular the longstanding practice of raising a leg or legs from the ground on Nelson in an effort to avoid ill fate.  When crowds noticed this, they would cheer his leg-raising. [PAR] The equivalent superstitious number in Australian cricket is 87, or the \"Devil's Number\".  Many, including commentators and journalists, mistakenly think 87 is considered unlucky because it is thirteen shy of 100 however it came to be known as the \"Devil's Number\" after Ian Johnson was dismissed for 87 while playing grade cricket and Keith Miller commented \"That's funny, I once saw Bradman dismissed for 87\".  It turned out that Bradman had actually been dismissed for 89 and the MCG scorers hadn't updated his last two runs before his dismissal however the superstition remained. Statistics have shown that more Australian batsmen are in fact dismissed on the numbers surrounding 87.  [PAR] On 11 November 2011, in a match between South Africa and Australia with the time at 11:11 with South Africa requiring 111 runs to win, the majority of the crowd and umpire Ian Gould did Shepherd's leg raise Nelson for that minute with the scoreboard reading 11:11 11/11/11.[DOC] [TLE] A 'Nelson' refers to a score of 111 ... - The IndependentA 'Nelson' refers to a score of 111, made by either a team or an individual, which is traditionally regarded as extremely unlucky | The Independent [PAR] A 'Nelson' refers to a score of 111, made by either a team or an individual, which is traditionally regarded as extremely unlucky\n\n\n### Answer:\nnelson </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Described as a 'tragedy of sorrows', the story tells of Nell uprooted from a secure and innocent childhood and cast into a world where evil takes many shapes, the most fascinating of which is the stunted, lecherous Quilp. Blending realism with non-realistic genres such as fairy-tale, allegory, and pastoral, the tale of Nell's tragedy contains some of Dickens most memorable comic and grotesque creations, including the dwarf Daniel Quilp, Dick Swiveller and Kit Nubbles.

The programme ran on ITV from 6 January 1980 to 6 December 2002, before being revived by the same channel in 2006 under the title of All Star Family Fortunes . The game involves two families providing answers to 'everyday questions' that were surveyed by 100 members of the British public before the show (e.g. 'Name something usually done in the dark') to win cash prizes (and sometimes mystery prizes for giving a correct answer). The top answers to the surveys are displayed on a large electronic board, originally known as \"Mr. Babbage\", which famously sounds a wrong answer \"Eh-uhh\" sound effect and its accompanying X to signal the strike, as well as a \"ding\" for a right answer). [PAR] Contents [PAR] 11 External links [PAR] Hosts and presentation[ edit ] [PAR] Family Fortunes was first hosted by comedian Bob Monkhouse (1980\u201383) then by singer and entertainer Max Bygraves (1983\u201385). After being rested for the whole of 1986, the show returned on 27 June 1987 with Les Dennis as presenter, and had a consistently successful run for the next 15 years. It was then moved out of peak time and became a daily daytime show, hosted by Andy Collins , but it only had a short run in this format before being axed. [PAR] In 2006, the series was revived with Vernon Kay as host, and was renamed All Star Family Fortunes , as each team consisted of a celebrity and four family members. The show was also transmitted back to peak time. Prize money goes to a charity of the celebrity's choice, and contestants being either celebrity families, or a group of actors famous for playing a fictional family. Several Christmas specials of All Star Family Fortunes have aired as well. [PAR] The most iconic aspects of the show are the large computer screen, named \"Mr Babbage\" by original host Bob Monkhouse and the famous computerised \"Eh-uhh\" sound used when wrong answers are given. Both were originally designed to appear high-tech but have since become fondly regarded for being quite the opposite (as compared to the original US Feud, which has used a video board since its 1999 revival). The computer screen name \"Mr Babbage\" was in recognition to the English mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer who originated the concept of a programmable computer, Charles Babbage . [PAR] Format[ edit ] [PAR] Two family teams, each with five members, are asked to guess the results of surveys, in which 100 people would be asked open ended questions (e.g. \"we asked 100 people to name something associated with the country Wales\" or \"we asked 100 people to name a breed of dog\"). Although rarely acknowledged in the show, the 100 people surveyed are invariably audience members who have volunteered before the show. [PAR] Each round begins with a member of each family (in rotation, meaning all players do this at least once) approaching the podium. As the question is read, the first of the two nominees to hit a buzzer gives an answer. If this is not the most popular answer, the other nominee is asked. The family with the more popular answer then chooses whether to \"play\" the question, or \"pass\" control to the other family. [PAR] The host then passes down the line of the controlling team, asking for an answer from each. After each answer, the board reveals whether this answer featured. If not, the family is assessed a strike, and the family loses control of the board after accumulating three strikes (also referred as striking out) in the round. If a family manages to come up with all the survey answers (most commonly six in the early part of the show, reduced in number after the commercial break) before striking out, they win the amount in pounds of the total\n\n\n### Answer:\nmax bygraves </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Headquartered in Bologna, Italy, Ducati is owned by German automotive  manufacturer Audi through its Italian subsidiary Lamborghini, which is all owned by the Volkswagen Group. [PAR] History [PAR]  In 1926 Antonio Cavalieri Ducati and his three sons, Adriano, Marcello, and Bruno Cavalieri Ducati; founded Societ\u00e0 Scientifica Radio Brevetti Ducati in Bologna to produce vacuum tubes, condensers and other radio components. In 1935 they had become successful enough to enable construction of a new factory in the Borgo Panigale area of the city.  Production was maintained during World War II, despite the Ducati factory being a repeated target of Allied bombing. [PAR] Meanwhile, at the small Turinese firm SIATA (Societa Italiana per Applicazioni Tecniche Auto-Aviatorie), Aldo Farinelli began developing a small pushrod engine for mounting on bicycles. Barely a month after the official liberation of Italy in 1944, SIATA announced its intention to sell this engine, called the \"Cucciolo\" (Italian for \"puppy,\" in reference to the distinctive exhaust sound) to the public. The first Cucciolos were available alone, to be mounted on standard bicycles, by the buyer; however, businessmen soon bought the little engines in quantity, and offered complete motorized-bicycle units for sale. [PAR] In 1950, after more than 200,000 Cucciolos had been sold, in collaboration with SIATA, the Ducati firm finally offered its own Cucciolo-based motorcycle. This first Ducati motorcycle was a 48\u00a0cc bike weighing , with a top speed of , and had a 15 mm  giving just under . Ducati soon dropped the Cucciolo name in favor of \"55M\" and \"65TL\". [PAR] When the market moved toward larger motorcycles, Ducati management decided to respond, making an impression at an early-1952 Milan show, introducing their 65TS cycle and Cruiser (a four-stroke motor scooter). Despite being described as the most interesting new machine at the 1952 show, the Cruiser was not a great success, and only a few thousand were made over a two-year period before the model ceased production. [PAR] In 1953, management split the company into two separate entities, Ducati Meccanica SpA and Ducati Elettronica, in acknowledgment of its diverging motorcycle and electronics product lines. Ducati Elettronica became Ducati Energia SpA in the eighties. Dr. Giuseppe Montano took over as head of Ducati Meccanica SpA and the Borgo Panigale factory was modernized with government assistance. By 1954, Ducati Meccanica SpA had increased production to 120 bikes a day. [PAR] In the 1960s, Ducati earned its place in motorcycling history by producing the fastest 250\u00a0cc road bike then available, the Mach 1.    In the 1970s Ducati began producing large-displacement V-twin  motorcycles and in 1973, released a V-twin with the trademarked desmodromic valve design. In 1985, Cagiva bought Ducati and planned to rebadge Ducati motorcycles with the \"Cagiva\" name. By the time the purchase was completed, Cagiva kept the \"Ducati\" name on its motorcycles. Eleven years later, in 1996, Cagiva accepted the offer from Texas Pacific Group and sold a 51% stake in the company for US$325 million; then, in 1998, Texas Pacific Group bought most of the remaining 49% to become the sole owner of Ducati. In 1999, TPG issued an initial public offering of Ducati stock and renamed the company \"Ducati Motor Holding SpA\". TPG sold over 65% of its shares in Ducati, leaving TPG the majority shareholder. In December 2005, Ducati returned to Italian ownership with the sale of Texas Pacific's stake (minus one share) to Investindustrial Holdings, the investment fund of Carlo and Andrea Bonomi. [PAR] In April 2012, Volkswagen Group's Audi subsidiary announced its intention to buy Ducati for \u20ac (US$). Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, a motorcycle enthusiast, had long coveted Ducati, and had regretted that he passed up an opportunity to buy the company from the Italian government in 1984.

[PAR] Violin Bow Materials [PAR] A bow typically consists of a length of wood with some other material stretched between its ends. The type of bow used to play the violin and related instruments has many hairs stretched between its ends, but bows used in other cultures often stretch a single piece of string between the ends of the wood. [PAR] Fine modern bows used to play orchestral string instruments of the violin family (the violin, viola, cello and double bass) are usually made of Pernambuco wood from Brazil and are strung with horse-hair. Silver or gold, ebony wood from Africa, ivory, pearl shell, leather, and sometimes tortoise shell are materials commonly used for the \"frog\" and finger grip. Some fine synthetic bows are also made of fiberglass and other man made materials. Cheaper bows can also be made of synthetic materials and less suitable types of wood. [PAR] A bow maker or luthier typically uses 150 hairs for the bows for violin family instruments. Inexpensive bows often use nylon or synthetic hair. Rosin , which is sticky and made from tree sap, is regularly applied to the bow hair so that the bow moving across the instrument's strings will cause the string to vibrate and produce a tone. [PAR] Bowing [PAR] The characteristic long, sustained, and singing sound produced by the violin, viola, violoncello, and double bass is due to the drawing of the bow against their strings. This sustaining of musical sound with a bow is comparable to a singer using breath to sustain sounds and sing long, smooth, or legato melodies. Without the bow the violin family could only be played pizzicato. [PAR] When the player pulls the bow across the strings, it is called a downbow; pushing in the direction of the tip is an upbow (the directions \"down\" and \"up\" are literally descriptive for violins and violas, and are employed in analogous fashion for the cello). [PAR] Generally, the downbow stroke is used for the strong musical beats, the upbow for weak beats. However, in the viola da gamba, it is the reverse; thus violinists, violists, and cellists look like they are \"pulling\" on the strong beats when they play, whereas gamba players looks like they are \"stabbing\" on the strong beats. The difference almost certainly results from the different ways in which the bow is held in these instrument families: violin/viola/cello players hold the wood part of the bow closer to the palm, whereas gamba players use the opposite orientation, with the horsehair closer. The orientation appropriate to each instrument family permits the stronger wrist muscles (flexors) to reinforce the strong beat. [PAR] Playing an instrument by touching the strings with the wood of the bow rather than the hair is known by the Italian phrase col legno. Arco in Italian is the indication to use the bow hair to create the sound. See also: Sul ponticello, Sul tasto, Col legno. [PAR] With the rise of the authentic performance movement, string players have developed a revived interest in the lighter, pre-Tourte bow, as more suitable for playing stringed instruments made in pre-19th century style. [PAR] Origin of the Bow [PAR] The question of when and where the bow was invented is of interest because the bow made possible several of the most important instruments in music today. Authorities give different answers to this question, and this article will give only the predominant opinion. [PAR] Scholars are agreed that stringed instruments as a category existed long before the bow. There was a long period\u2014possibly thousands of years\u2014in which all stringed instruments were plucked. [PAR] In fact, it is likely that bowed instruments are not much more than a thousand years old. Eric Halfpenny, writing in the 1988 Encyclopedia Britannica, says \"bowing can be traced as far back as the Islamic civilization of the 10th century ... it seems likely that the principle of bowing originated among the horse cultures of\n\n\n### Answer:\nbows </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Conventionally the term has been most widely applied to simple teaching of the skills of dealing with numbers for practical purposes, e.g., computation of areas, proportions, costs, and the like. The four fundamental operations of this study are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In advanced study the concept of number is greatly generalized to include not only complex numbers, but also quaternions, tensors, and abstract entities with no other meaning than that they obey certain laws (see algebra ). The division of arithmetic into the practical and the theoretical dates back to classical Greek times, when the term logistic referred to elementary arithmetic and the term arithmetic was reserved for the theory.

[PAR] Checking accounts online One critical use of daily arithmetic is checking accounts online.  With the threat of identity theft and online banking, it is critical to be able to possess an overall sense of basic arithmetic in such settings. [PAR] The word \"Arithmetic\" is from Greek \"arithmos\", meaning \"number\".  Arithmetic is the most basic form of mathematics. It concerns counting  and working with numbers and fractions based on the four operations:  addition, subtraction, multiplication and division although the more  advanced operations, such as manipulations of percentages, square root,  exponentiation and logarithmic functions, are also a part of this  subject. In one way or another, every equation, graph, and an enormous amount of other things can be broken down into these four basic operations. As people say, math is a language, and addition subtraction, multiplication, and division are its alphabet, along with the number line as well. Arithmetic is performed according to an order of operations.  Historically, the researchers have found that the initial significance  of arithmetic had been realized during the third century B.C. [PAR] The term \"arithmetic\" is also used to refer to elementary number  theory.            This includes the properties of integers related to primality, divisibility, and the solution of equations in integers, as well as modern research that is an outgrowth of this study. It's in this context that one runs across the fundamental  theorem of arithmetic and arithmetical functions. From a general perspective, arithmetic allows individuals to think, reflect, and reason out. Plato, who is one of the greatest philosophers of all time, believed that any person who has good arithmetic skills will also do very well in other knowledge-based competencies. [PAR] Arithmetic  is used by almost everyone, for tasks ranging from simple day-to-day  counting to advanced science and business calculations. It is difficult to think of a situation where an average person does not make regular use of arithmetic in daily life. For example, we use arithmetic for so many routine activities like: finding out time by looking at our watches, figuring out how many more days of school before we get off for Saturday and Sunday and so on. [PAR] The modern science and its achievements has a great contribution from arithmetic. We cannot analyze light, electricity or a tiniest atom which uses mathematics which has its paternity in arithmetic only. Mathematics has its sound base in arithmetic and can be used as tool to critically examine and asses both physical and abstract things. Any thing can be quantified for its quality and special characteristics and then it can be compared, assessed or examined.

Mercury (Greek: Hermes) was the Roman god of commerce, travel and  industry, Venus (Greek: Aphrodite) was the goddess of love and beauty, Mars (Greek: Ares) was the god of war, Jupiter (Greek: Zeus) was the king of the gods, and Saturn (Greek: Cronos) was the god of agriculture. Hundreds  of years later, even when people knew that the planets weren't actually gods, they still kept with tradition  and named newly discovered planets after mythological characters. Uranus, Neptune and Pluto were all discovered  in modern times, but their names are all still linked to ancient myths. Uranus is the Greek ruler of the heavens, Neptune (Greek: Poseidon) is the Roman god of the sea, and Pluto (Greek: Hades) is god of the  underworld. The names of moons orbiting planets are also influenced by mythology. This is all except for one planet. The moons  orbiting Uranus are named after characters in plays, mostly after characters in plays written by William  Shakespeare. Why would you name moons after characters in a play though? Before I answer that, here's my  quick guide to Shakespeare. [PAR] One of the greatest ever writers of the English language was William  Shakespeare. He was born on 23rd April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon, England and during his life,  wrote about 154 poems (called sonnets) and 38 plays. From 1588, he lived in London where many of his  plays were performed in front of the courts of the Royal Family. Although his plays are now over 400  years old, they are still performed and studied today, containing themes and ideas which are as relevant  now as they were when they were first written. The Globe Theatre in London was opened in 2000 and is a  modern day replica of the type of theatre in which Shakespeare's plays would have originally been  performed. Some of Shakespeare's most famous plays are Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, Hamlet and A Midsummer  Night's Dream. Shakespeare died on 23rd April 1616 and is buried in Stratford-upon-Avon church. Although Shakespeare wrote a large number of plays, these plays can be placed into four categories: Comedies, Histories, Tragedies and Romances. The Comedies were often farcical comedies of error, kind of like Fawlty Towers for the 16th Century (e.g. A Midsummer Night's Dream) . The Histories were based on real historical events, usually about English history (Henry IV, Part 1) or ancient history. Tragedies were plays with darker themes (such as betrayal and jealousy) and by the end of the play, most of the characters had died! (Romeo and Juliet, King Lear). The Romances were a bit lighter in theme and featured elements of fantasy and magic (A Winter's Tale, The Tempest). [PAR] William Shakespeare is a hugely influential figure in English literature today. Students still analyse and discuss his works, and tourists from all over the world visit Stratford-upon-Avon to visit Shakespeare's house (pictured right).  His importance inspired William Herschel in 1787 to name some of the moons known to be orbiting Uranus after characters in Shakespeare's plays. [PAR] In 1781, Uranus became the first planet to be \" discovered \". The other planets that were known of at the time ( Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter and Saturn ) plus the Sun and the Moon had been observed for tens of thousands of years from Earth and already had names, named by the Greeks and Romans after their gods. Before 1781, nobody knew that Uranus existed and people thought there were only six planets\n\n\n### Answer:\nuranus </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] The scantily clad apparition with the croquet mallet strides through the gate  and approaches the lawn, Jesus slippers flip-flopping with each step against  the bare soles of his feet.  He pauses at court's edge, puts down his ragged  backpack and extracts from it a vial of sun lotion, which he proceeds to  apply to every square inch of exposed flesh, and there's a lot of it.  He  wears below only a bikini thong, while on top a tie-dyed tank top mercifully  conceals from view a considerable gut overhanging pale, hairy legs. [PAR] Oblivious to the disapproving frowns of other club members courtside, he  wipes his oily paws on the tank top and takes from the backpack a big cigar,  lights it, and puffs greedily as he raises his gaze to survey the court,  teeth exposed in a half-smile of satisfaction.  Spying a set of balls nearby,  he sets himself a three-ball break and begins knocking the balls around the  court, enjoying the feel of the warm sun on his freshly oiled skin, happily  puffing smoke with each good hit, prepared to enjoy a couple of hours  indulging his full rights as a member in good standing. [PAR] This apparition is the worst fear of the all-white croquet fashion nazis who  vehemently resist all change.  Is it a reasonable fear? [PAR] Whites down under, 1951: The South Australia test team exudes confidence in their cool white culottes and sporty hats. Reprinted by permission of CROQUET AUSTRALIA. [PAR] The history of this debate over the last decade suggests that it is not. Lawn bowlers began to  relax their all-white clothing standard many years ago, but if you visit a  lawn bowling facility anywhere in the world, you are likely to see everyone  in white.  Croquet New Zealand changed its regulation last year to a very loose injunction suggesting \"appropriate\" clothing, but those few who shun whites are still the exception  that proves the continued dominance of all-whites.  Local clubs here and  there - for all manner of reasons - have eased their costume restrictions,  but evidence of significant change in the croquet fashion culture is hard to  find. [PAR] Revolutionists point to recent rulings of the Croquet Players Association of  New South Wales which, according to Peter Tavender, president of the CPA [the  official state organization], were widely misinterpreted. \"The Council  meeting,\" he says, \"rejected two motions...to do away with wearing whites for  CPA events and a similar motion for the ACA events.  The only motion that was  passed was that the CPA encourage clubs to 'amend their regulations to remove  the compulsory wearing of whites'.\" [PAR] The real movement is towards more freedom of choice [PAR] Whites with an attitude, 1985:  If the models in this San Francisco fashion shoot had stuck around to play the game, croquet might have changed its image without adopting colours. [PAR] The CPA of New South Wales was not decreeing a new clothing standard, but  only allowing local clubs freedom of choice in the matter - the same kind of  freedom of choice that also now applies in South Australia, according to  Wendy Davidson, editor of CROQUET AUSTRALIA: \"The latest (1999) in South Australia is that you wear a club uniform or predominately white when playing in SACA events, and each club can decide what is worn at their club at any time.  Most clubs, in fact all clubs I know of in South Australia, have coloured winter gear.  As in New South Wales, the tops can be shirts or polo necked skivvies, and the bottoms can be skirts, trousers, slacks, track suit pants, and the outers can be jackets\n\n\n### Answer:\ncroquet </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

As a footballer he played as a central defender from 1986 to 2003, and was voted the 17th \"hardest footballer of all time\". [PAR] He made his debut at Millwall, having been associated with the club since the age of 13, and also represented Tottenham Hotspur, Southampton, Liverpool, West Ham, Crystal Palace, Queens Park Rangers and Swindon Town during a professional career spanning 17 years. He was capped once by England, in 1994. [PAR] Ruddock came out of retirement in 2015, aged 46, to play for United Counties League side Wellingborough Whitworth. [PAR] Southampton [PAR] Ruddock joined Southampton in February 1989 in a \u00a3200,000 transfer from Millwall. A rugged, uncompromising defender, he soon became popular with the Southampton fans especially after confidently tucking away a penalty against Newcastle United on 1 April in only his sixth game for the club, thus helping the \"Saints\" earn their first victory in 18 matches and start Southampton on a climb away from the relegation zone. His goal celebration after the 89th-minute penalty became known as the \"Ruddock stomp\". Ruddock missed his next two penalties, allowing Matt Le Tissier to take over for the following season. [PAR] Sponsored Links [PAR] Despite early disciplinary problems at The Dell, Ruddock's talents as a confident, left-footed defender earned him England Under-21 honours. Powerful in the air, he could tackle strongly but was also able to bring the ball forward out of defence. [PAR] In the 1991\u201392 season, Ruddock was a member of the Southampton side that reached the final of the Zenith Data Systems Cup, where they were beaten in extra time 3\u20132 by Nottingham Forest. [PAR] After three years on the south coast, he was enticed back to Tottenham by Terry Venables in May 1992, with the tribunal setting the transfer fee at a \"ridiculous\" \u00a3750,000. [PAR] Liverpool [PAR] Ruddock was signed by Liverpool from Tottenham Hotspur on a \u00a32.5 million transfer. Whilst at Liverpool, Ruddock was famously involved in an on-field scuffle with Manchester United star Eric Cantona. Ruddock responded to Cantona's taunts about his weight by turning down the Frenchman's collar - in his after dinner speaking, Ruddock says of the incident- \"trust me to pick the only Frenchman around who wanted a tear-up\". Ruddock was never far from controversy in his time at Liverpool, with tabloids highlighting his personal weight problems, parenting issues, philandering, marital issues and drink driving infringements, including an infamous incident involving his \"Porsche and a blonde\" as confirmed by Suleman his private servant. In 1995, he was absolved of fracturing Peter Beardsley's jaw with an elbow in a testimonial match, to which Beardsley contemplated legal action on the grounds that Ruddock acted deliberately, but later decided to withdraw charges. In 1996, Ruddock's tackle on Andrew Cole of Manchester United in a reserve game at Anfield left the player with two broken legs, and Ruddock claimed innocence, while Cole said he believed Ruddock did not intend harm. However, in a 2010 interview with Talksport, he jokingly refers to the incident as \"not big, and not clever\", adding \"but it was great\", and that \"I didn't mean to break both of his legs if I'm honest, I only meant to break one\".

It speaks volumes that Mr. Radford achieves a triumph with a film that for all practical purposes should have been directed by an Italian. This is a timeless story of friendship, poetry and love set in a desolated island that was to be Pablo Neruda's home in exile. [PAR] The story is a simple one. Mario Ruoppolo, a poor man without a job, suddenly applies for a vacant position that will pay almost nothing, but by becoming a letter carrier he gets the chance of meeting a man that will make a deep impression on him and who will change his life completely. [PAR] Mario, the postman, is almost illiterate. He can read and write, with only the basic knowledge he probably picked up in the island school. He is allergic to fishing, and can't make a living like his father, and probably most of his ancestors before him. It's the time after WWII in which a poor Italy is still recovering from the devastation and defeat. [PAR] Pablo Neruda, the Chilean poet, finds a rustic home in the island. He is the most famous person ever to set foot in there. Mario is in charge for bringing Pablo his packages and mail. An easy friendship develops between them. Like everyone else in the island, Mario is impressed by the foreigner. In trying to imitate his poet friend, Mario awakens to all the beauty around him and discovers love with the gorgeous local girl, Beatrice Russo. [PAR] The film's mood changes right after Pablo Neruda and his wife receive assurances they can go back to their native land. This leaves Mario in a sad state, but now that he is married, he has other responsibilities to live for. Neruda had awakened in Mario a desire to speak for himself and to seek justice. [PAR] This is a film totally dominated by the late Italian actor Massimo Troisi, who as Mario, completely captures us by just being a simple soul with no malice. Mr. Troisi is splendid in his take of this poor man who discovers beauty and poetry late in his life. Philippe Noiret, is Pablo Neruda. Mr. Noiret makes a great contribution as the man who sees beauty everywhere and translates it into poetry. Maria Grazia Cucinotta is the beautiful Beatrice, the woman who loves Mario. Renato Scarpa and Linda Moretti, play minor roles with success. [PAR] \"Il Postino\" is helped by the magnificent cinematography of Franco di Giacomo who captures the island in all its splendor. The music score is another asset. Luis Bacalov's tuneful background music adds another layer in this film rich texture. [PAR] This film is an excellent way to be introduced to Pablo Neruda's poetry, even if it's only for the curiosity the film will give even a casual viewer. Thanks to Michael Radford for a poetic view of this lonely place where two people meet and are changed forever. [PAR] Was the above review useful to you? [PAR] 40 out of 51 people found the following review useful: [PAR] Poetry in motion [PAR] from Pasadena, CA [PAR] 9 April 2001 [PAR] A beautiful movie that does an excellent job bringing to life Neruda's love poems and how they touch the life of a simpleton postman. It inspires in one, a spiritual and sensual love for poetry. The music is intricately woven into the fabric of the story, and is surely a high point in the movie. Great cinematography, matched frame by frame with the splendid acting, especially that of Massimo Troisi and Philippe Noiret. Watch this movie if you are disillusioned with the notion of romance, and need some succour. [PAR] The movie once again reinforces my admiration for the Italian film-makers. What amazes me is their simplicity in relating a tale, and how subtly pathos is displayed in their movies.

On November 9, 1922, he was named the winner of the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.\" [PAR] The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from the surface of matter [PAR] (usually metals) when light shines on it. Einstein explained the effect by proposing that light consists of small particles, or quanta, called photons, which carry energy that is proportional to the frequency of light. The electrons in the matter that absorb the energy of the photon get ejected. He published these findings in 1905 in the paper \"On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light.\" Einstein's observations that the photoelectric effect could be explained only if light behaves like a particle, not a wave, was instrumental in establishing the hypothesis that light can behave both like a wave and a particle. [PAR] The photoelectric effect is the basis for photosynthesis. It also forms the basis for a variety of devices such as photodiodes, which are used in light detection within fiber optics, telecommunications networks, solar cells, imaging, and many other applications. [PAR] An interesting note: Records show the Nobel Prize Awarding Institution, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, decided to reserve the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, and therefore awarded no Physics prize that year. According to the statutes, a reserved prize can be awarded the year after, and Albert Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize for 1921 one year later, in 1922. [PAR] Einstein was unable to attend the December 10 Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm. He presented his Nobel speech on July 11, 1923, in Gothenburg. [PAR] Einstein died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, NJ.

[PAR] From Everybody: [PAR] \"The Little Family Just Got Bigger.\" [PAR] Plot: [PAR] Eleanor Little (Geena Davis) and Frederick Little (Hugh Laurie) and their young son George (Jonathan Lipnicki) are intending an adoption. While George is at school, his parents go to an orphanage where they meet and fall in love with a humanoid mouse named Stuart (voiced by Michael J. Fox). Despite misgivings from Mrs. Keeper (Julia Sweeney), they adopt Stuart and take him home. However, Stuart is greeted coldly by George, who refuses to acknowledge the mouse as his brother, and the family cat Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane), who is disgusted at having a mouse for a \"master\". Despite Eleanor and Frederick's intentions, Stuart quickly feels like an outsider in the large Little family, especially when the family's unknowing relatives bring Stuart large presents and George snaps at his family, claiming out loud that Stuart is not his brother. When Stuart admits his feelings of loneliness to his parents, they ask Mrs. Keeper to do some background research on Stuart's biological family.After accidentally stumbling across George's playroom in the basement, Stuart finally bonds with George when they play together and plan to finish George's remote controlled boat, the Wasp, for an upcoming boat race in Central Park. At the same time, however, one of Snowbell's alley cat friends, Monty (voiced by Steve Zahn) visits unexpectedly and discovers Stuart. Determined not to have his reputation destroyed, Snowbell meets with Monty's leader, Smokey (voiced by Chazz Palminteri), a mafia don-like alley cat, and plans to have Stuart removed from the household without harming him.Stuart and George finish the Wasp in time for the race, but on the day of the race, the control is smashed when a bystander accidentally steps on it. Stuart pilots the Wasp himself, but ends up in a tussle with a larger boat belonging to George's rival, Anton, who has already smashed the rest of the boats without being disqualified. Stuart snaps the wires of Anton's boat and manages to win the race, at the same time finally winning George's acceptance and respect. During the family celebration, however, the Little's are visited by a mouse couple, Reginald and Camille Stout (voiced by Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly), who claim to be Stuart's parents who gave him up to the orphanage years ago due to poverty. Reluctantly, Stuart leaves with the Stouts, George presenting him with his toy car as a farewell gift. A few days later, however, Mrs. Keeper comes to visit and tells the Little's that Stuart's parents actually died many years ago in a supermarket accident. Realizing their son has been kidnapped, the Little's call the police and stick posters of Stuart's face across the city.Meanwhile, Snowbell meets with Smokey and the alley cats: he had actually conspired with them to have the Stouts pose as Stuart's parents in order to remove Stuart from the household. Fearing retribution should the Little's discover Snowbell's deception, Smokey orders the Stouts to hand Stuart over to them, but the Stouts, having grown to truly love Stuart, tell him to flee. Smokey subsequently orders a manhunt for Stuart. They corner him in Central Park and a chase ensues. Despite losing his car and almost falling down a storm drain, Stuart manages to evade Smokey and return home, unfortunately, while the Little's are out putting posters up. The only one present is Snowbell, who lies that the Little's have been enjoying themselves greatly since Stuart's departure, and uses Stuart's removed face from the family photograph as proof (which they had actually used for the posters). Heartbroken, Stuart leaves again, but Snowbell begins to question his actions when he sees the pain the Little's are going through.The alley cats locate Stuart in Central Park and bring Snowbell for the hunt.

[PAR] Castor (held by a giant) and Polydeuces from the Pergamon Zeus Altar [PAR] They are called the Dioscuri (dios kouroi), meaning the \"Sons of Zeus \", although the story of their parentage is confused, as it is for their sisters Helen and Clytemnestra. The best known story is that Zeus disguised himself as a swan and seduced Leda. Thus Leda's children are frequently said to have hatched from two eggs that she then produced. By many accounts, however, Leda's mortal husband Tyndareus could also have fathered some of the children. Which children are thus mortal and which half-immortal is not consistent among accounts, nor is which children hatched from which egg. Castor and Polydeuces are sometimes both mortal, sometimes both divine. One consistent point is that if only one of them is immortal, it is Polydeuces. [PAR] As a further complication, the Zeus swan story is sometimes associated with the goddess Nemesis. In this tradition, it was Nemesis who was seduced and who laid the egg, but the egg was then found by or given to Leda. However, this story is usually associated with Helen, not with Castor and Polydeuces. [PAR] Polydeuces was a powerful boxer, and Castor a great horseman.

A good actor brings such a role into focus, as Will Smith does in the enigmatically titled \"Seven Pounds.\" Who is he, what does he want, why is he behaving so oddly for an IRS agent? And why won't he kiss Rosario Dawson , when they both so obviously want that to happen? [PAR] Advertisement [PAR] As Ben Thomas, the man from the IRS, he can get in anywhere and ask any question. But surely the IRS doesn't require him to punch a nursing home supervisor for not allowing an old lady her bath? And why, after he intuits he is speaking to a blind man on the phone, is he so needlessly cruel to him? And why then does he follow the same man ( Woody Harrelson ) into a restaurant and engage him in conversation? [PAR] And why does he check into a fleabag hotel? Doesn't the IRS pay him a salary? And what favor does his lifelong friend Dan ( Barry Pepper ) owe him? And why is he looking for people who need their own favors? And so on. For much of the first hour of \"Seven Pounds,\" Ben Thomas acts according to a plan that seems perfectly clear, but only to himself. The reason it goes unexplained is that he has no need to explain it to himself, and no way to explain it to anyone else. [PAR] I am reminded of a film you should see some day, Melville's \" Le Samourai ,\" about a man who lies on a bed in a dark hotel room and smokes, and gets up, and pays meticulous attention to his appearance, and goes out into the night, and we have no idea who this man is. I find this more interesting than a movie about a man whose nature and objectives are made clear in the first five minutes, in a plot that simply points him straight ahead. [PAR] Advertisement [PAR] Will Smith displays a rather impressive range of emotional speeds here. He can be a tough, merciless IRS man. He can bend the rules on some cases. He can have a candlelight dinner with a beautiful woman named Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson) and go home afterward. She can sense his deep sadness. He is angry with people sometimes, but he seems angriest of all at himself. It's quite a performance. [PAR] And Dawson makes Emily not simply a woman confused, maybe offended, by his behavior, but a woman of instinctive empathy, who does an emotional dance with him, following his lead when he needs to be treated like an IRS agent or like a perfect gentleman or like a man who needs understanding even if she doesn't know what she's supposed to understand.

[PAR] Scientific names are important because they provide the means for growers and those in the scientific community to accurately reference and discuss the same plant.\u00a0 Even if you're not a scientist, the one way to ensure you're getting the exact plant you want at your local nursery is to use its scientific name.\u00a0 [PAR] Yes, scientific names are Latin.\u00a0 Yes, they're standardized.\u00a0 But don't let either of those things intimidate you.\u00a0\u00a0 If you know a few basics, they're also fun as you can start to puzzle out details of the plants they're naming.\u00a0 Don't forget that English is full of words with Latin origins, so it's often logical to work out meanings.\u00a0 The following is a very brief overview of scientific names as they relate to tea.\u00a0\u00a0 [PAR] Early Scientific Names for Tea [PAR] The first scientific mention of tea in the West came in 1712 when it was called Thea.\u00a0 Thea came from t'e, the word used for tea in the Amoy dialect.\u00a0 Then in 1753 Carl von Linn\u00e9 of Sweden (more commonly known as Linnaeus) included tea in his groundbreaking work, Species Plantarum. \u00a0Although he described tea plants in its pages, the work is best known for the simple and effective formula for naming plants that Linnaeus introduced in it to replace an extraordinarily cumbersome system.\u00a0 In fact, the system he introduced is the one we still use today. [PAR] With his binomial (two names) system, every plant is assigned two latinized names that together uniquely identify it: a genus and a specific epithet that together comprise the species name.\u00a0 For tea, Camellia is the plant's genus name, sinensis is its specific epithet, and the species is Camellia sinensis.\u00a0 Explanations follow. [PAR] Genus, Camellia [PAR] Plants of the same genus are closely related based on similarities in their flowers, fruits, and sometimes other plant parts or traits.\u00a0 While there are approximately 80 species of plants in the genus Camellia, they are all small evergreens native to eastern Asia having simple leaves with serrated edges (see Tea Plants\u2014What They Look Like ).\u00a0 [PAR] A genus is often named after a person (a latinized version of it) or after ancient Greek and Roman names given to plants. \u00a0Camellia is most likely named for Georg Josef Kamel.\u00a0 He was a Jesuit missionary and pharmacist who collected plants while traveling through Asia.\u00a0 He is known to have sent plants from the Philippines to Europe between 1683\u20131700, and later he wrote about them using his latinized name of\u00a0 Cam\u0115llus.\u00a0 Thus, tea's genus became Camellia.\u00a0 [PAR] Specific Epithet, sinensis [PAR] A specific epithet further defines a plant to distinguish it from related plants of the same genus.\u00a0 In the case of tea, the word sinensis indicates the plant's origin in China.\u00a0 It stems from the Greek and Roman names for China, \"Sinai\" or \"Sinae.\" [PAR] Probably the most common other Camellia is the garden camellia, Camellia japonica (native to Japan, but successfully grown in mild parts of the U.S. like the Pacific Northwest and the Carolinas).\u00a0 It's known for its gorgeous blossoms that can reach 5\" (13 cm.) in diameter.\u00a0\u00a0 Flower size is one of the characteristics distinguishing it from the tea plant whose blooms are much smaller. [PAR] Species, Camellia sinensis [PAR] Plants within a species are similar in form, share other distinctive traits, and are capable of interbreeding.\u00a0 A species is usually isolated reproductively from other related species.

Ten years after his death and resurrection as RoboCop, Alex Murphy (Page Fletcher) has begun to feel his age. On the verge of obsolescence, RoboCop must also contend with the fact that his now-grown son, James (Anthony Lemke), is an OCP executive who is unaware that his father is still alive. In addition, RoboCop's former partner, John T. Cable (Maurice Dean Wint) has returned to Delta City as its new Security Commander. [PAR] But there is a new threat to Delta City: a mysterious vigilante called Bone Machine is cutting a swath through the criminal element of Delta City with the help of an experimental, armored combat suit.

[PAR] At OCP, Security Concepts chief Sara Cable (Maria Del Mar), John Cable's ex-wife, brings young James Murphy under her wing, inducting him into a secret group of executives known as The Trust. The Trust is attempting to overthrow the current executive board, but RoboCop and Cable's investigation into Bone Machine is coming dangerously close to exposing them. RoboCop is reprogrammed by The Trust with a new directive, instructing him to terminate John Cable.

[PAR] Status: \u00a0 False. [PAR] Origins: \u00a0 As Santa Claus and his reindeer are to the secular celebration of Christmas, so the three wise men and the creche are to the religious celebration.  Even most of the non-religious (or non-Christian) among us recognize the symbolism of the nativity scene: it depicts the biblical account of three wise men from the east who rode atop camels and followed a star to Bethlehem, bearing gifts for the newborn Christ child who lay in a manger. [PAR] The truth is, the Bible contains virtually none of these details.  They have all been added over the years from sources outside the Bible. [PAR] Mathew 2:1 tells us: [PAR] Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to [PAR] Jerusalem . . . [PAR] That's [PAR] it.  Matthew doesn't say how many wise men came from the east, doesn't mention their names, and doesn't provide any details about how they made their journey. [PAR] It has generally been assumed that the wise men (or magi) were three in number because Matthew 2:11 makes mention of three gifts: [PAR] \". . . they [PAR] presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.\"  The number of wise men is not specified in the Bible, however, and some Eastern religions have claimed up to twelve of them made the journey to Bethlehem.   The names of the wise men, Gaspar, Melchior, and Balthasar, do not come from the Bible and did not appear in Christian literature until over five hundred years after the birth of Jesus.  Nothing in the Bible says the wise men rode camels (or any other animal); they may have made their journey from the east on foot for all we know.  And despite the familiar lyrics of the Christmas carol \"We Three Kings,\" no biblical source depicts the three wise men as kings.  (They were most likely learned men, perhaps astrologers.) [PAR] However many wise men there were, and however they got to Bethlehem, the Bible tells us they arrived just after the birth and found the baby Jesus in a manger, right? [PAR] Not quite.  Matthew 2:11 states: [PAR] And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped [PAR] him . . . [PAR] The wise men came \"into the house,\" not the stable, and they saw a \"young child,\" not a newborn.  This passage indicates that the wise men didn't arrive until quite some time after Jesus' birth.  (According to [PAR] Luke 2, [PAR] it was shepherds, not wise men, who visited the infant Jesus in the manger.) [PAR] To sum up: we know from the Bible that wise men came from the east, that they followed a star to Bethlehem to find the Christ child, and that they brought him gold, and frankincense and myrrh.

It measures 2,857 km in length and up to 1.5 km in width, with depths between 1 to 8 metres and drains 817,000 km\u00b2. The scenic silver stream of the only eastbound river in Europe originates in Germany's Black Forest as the much smaller Brigach and Breg Rivers, which join at the town of Donaueschingen. The Danube then flows eastward, passing through several Central and Eastern European capitals before emptying into the Black Sea via the Danube Delta in Romania and Ukraine. [PAR] Considered Europe's lifeline, the basin includes the territories of 19 countries and is home to more than 83 million people with a wide range of cultures, languages and historical backgrounds, making it the single most international river, affecting more nations than any other river in the world.

[PAR] People have been aware of the Danube's importance since the dawn of mankind. In Latin the Danube was known as Danubius, Danuvius, or Ister, and in Ancient Greek as Istros. The name D\u0101nuvius is derived from the Indo-European word d\u0101nu, meaning \u201cprimeval cosmic river\u201d. The Indo-European root d\u0101 meaning \u201cto flow, rapid, violent, undisciplined\u201d whereas the Ancient Greek word Istros simply means \"strong\u201d or \u201cswift\u201d.

The Middle Basin is the largest of the three sub-regions, extending from Bratislava to the dams of the Iron Gate Gorge on the border between Serbia and Romania. The lowlands, plateaus and mountains of Romania and Bulgaria form the Lower Basin of the River Danube. Finally, the river divides into three main branches, forming the vast Danube Delta, which covers an area of about 6,750 km\u00b2. [PAR] Many tributaries flow into the Danube. The Inn is the third largest tributary by discharge, and the seventh longest. At the confluence in Passau, it contains more water than the mainstream of the Danube itself. [PAR] The River Morava/March enters the Danube from the north. Its catchment area includes parts of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria, the Carpathians and the Pannonian Plain. [PAR] The Drava River is the Danube's fourth largest and fourth longest tributary, and connects the Alps with the Danube and the Black Sea. [PAR] The Tisza River is the longest tributary of the Danube (966 km), and the second largest by flow, after the Sava River. The Tisza River Basin is the largest sub-basin in the Danube River Basin. [PAR] The Sava has the largest discharge of water to the Danube of any tributary and is the second largest by catchment area. The Sava is shared by Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro. [PAR] The Siret flows from its source in Ukraine into Romania. The Siret River Basin is the third-largest catchment area of any Danube tributary, and is situated to the east of the Carpathians. [PAR] The Prut River is the second longest (950 km) and the last major tributary of the Danube, with its confluence located just upstream of the Danube Delta. It begins in the forests of the Ukrainian Carpathians, and later forms the border between Romania and Moldova. [PAR] Protecting a Valuable Resource [PAR] Although the Danube is widely known as the \u201cBlue Danube\u201d, its water is far from being blue in most places. In recent decades, many dams and locks were built that interrupt the natural flow of the river on its majestic journey to the Black Sea.\n\n\n### Answer:\nblack sea </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Here is a brief sampling: [PAR] 3Com Corporation [PAR] ZIP Code History [PAR] A Brief History of the Development of the ZIP Code in the United States [PAR] ZIP Codes have an interesting history beginning with their inception in the early 1960's to their unintended use today in sales and marketing applications, internet technology, data collection and GIS. [PAR] ZIP Codes [PAR] The ZIP code is the system of postal codes used by the United States Postal Service        (USPS). The name ZIP, an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan, is written properly in       capital letters and was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently,       and therefore more quickly, when senders use it. The basic format consists of five       numerical digits. An extended ZIP + 4 code includes the five digits of the ZIP code,       a hyphen and then four more digits, which allow a piece of mail to be directed to       a more precise location than by the ZIP code alone. ZIP Code was originally registered       as a trademark by the U.S. Postal Service but its registration has since expired. [PAR] Background [PAR] The postal service implemented postal zones for large cities in 1943. For example: [PAR] John Hancock [PAR] 28 Prince St. [PAR] Boston 24, Massachusetts [PAR] The \"24\" in the example above is the number of the postal zone within the city. [PAR] By the early 1960s a more general system was needed, and on July 1, 1963, non-mandatory       ZIP codes were announced for the whole country. Robert Moon, an employee of the post       office, is considered the father of the ZIP code. He submitted his proposal in 1944 [PAR] while working as a postal inspector. [PAR] The post office only gives credit to Moon for the first three digits of the ZIP code,       which describe the region of the country. In most cases, the last two digits coincide       with the older postal zone number, thus: [PAR] John Hancock [PAR] Boston 24, Massachusetts 02113 [PAR] Enter Mr. ZIP [PAR] In 1967, these were made mandatory for second- and third-class bulk mailers, and       the system was soon adopted generally. The United States Post Office used a cartoon       character, Mr. ZIP, to promote use of the ZIP code. He was often depicted with a       legend such as \"USE ZIP CODES\" in the selvage of panes of stamps or on labels contained       in, or the covers of, booklet panes of stamps. Curiously enough, the only time the       Postal Service issued a stamp promoting the ZIP code, in 1974, Mr. ZIP was not depicted. Mr. ZIP promoted the use of ZIP codes for the USPS during the 1960s and 1970s. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Watch an early advertisement of \"The Swingin' Six\" hoping to persuade people to use ZIP Codes. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] In 1983, the U.S. Postal Service began using an expanded ZIP code system called \"ZIP [PAR] + 4\", often called \"plus-four codes\"\n\n\n### Answer:\n1960s </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] 10 \u2013 Joe Hart [PAR] Joe Hart has only been on the England international radar for a shot amount of time, but within that time he has made a big name for himself. [PAR] Hart has now made more than 20 appearances for his country and has kept plenty of clean sheets, including that vital one against the Ukraine in this year\u2019s Euros. [PAR] The current England shot stopper did not feature in the 2010 World Cup, but has been an England regular ever since, even being backed to be England captain by some pundits and players. [PAR] Hart has been praised for his strong performances in the England squad, along with a positive image off the pitch, and has had a good tournament. [PAR] His performances at this year\u2019s European Championships have established the 25-year-old as the best England keeper in recent years. [PAR] 9 \u2013 Nigel Martyn [PAR] Martyn debuted for England in 1992 but spent most of his career as understudy to first choice goalkeeper David Seaman. [PAR] Despite this, Martyn still accumulated 23 caps, making him the eleventh most capped English keeper ever. [PAR] Twelve of his 23 appearances were clean sheets, giving the England keeper the eighth highest clean sheet record for goalkeepers to date. [PAR] The timing of Martyn\u2019s career is a great shame, as in other eras of English football he would have walked right into the starting role and achieved far more international caps. [PAR] 8 \u2013 Paul Robinson [PAR] With 41 appearances to his name, Paul Robinson is the 7th most capped England goalkeeper ever. [PAR] Robinson\u2019s finest hour as England keeper came at the 2006 World Cup in Germany after replacing David James as England\u2019s first choice goalkeeper. [PAR] Robinson had great form at the tournament, keeping an impressive four clean sheets in five games, but his fine World Cup performance came undone at the hands of Portugal in a quarter-final penalty shootout, which England lost 3-1. [PAR] Following the World Cup Robinson was plagued by errors, including the infamous Gary Neville back pass against Croatia and the mistake which gifted Germany an opening goal in England\u2019s first loss at the new Wembley. [PAR] 7 \u2013 David James [PAR] Fifth most capped keeper David James made his first appearance for the England senior team in a friendly against Mexico in 1997. [PAR] Euro 2004 saw James start his first major international competition as first choice keeper, keeping one clean sheet at the tournament with England eventually going out on penalties to Portugal in the quarter-finals. [PAR] England legends Gordon Banks and David Seaman both backed James to be first choice keeper at the 2010 World Cup. [PAR] James replaced Green as England\u2019s number one at the tournament. He went on to keep two clean sheets against Algeria and Slovakia while becoming the oldest ever World Cup debutant and the oldest player at that year\u2019s tournament.

Instead, the question for Hollywood has always been: What can we do with this guy? How can we make him what, despite his enormous popularity, he has never been: a true box office star? [PAR] The advance press has suggested that his new movie, \"Good Morning, Vietnam,\" will change all that. And the movie does live up to part of its billing: It gives us a lot of Robin Williams. But it hardly delivers on the promise of giving us the pure, undiluted Williams -- Williams at his best. What's more, it's not even close to being his best movie. It's not even close to being good. [PAR] Set in Saigon in 1965, the movie introduces us to Adrian Cronauer (Williams), an Air Force disc jockey who'sbeen flown in from another assignment to a post at the center of the escalating conflict in Vietnam. The character is based on a real deejay who ran afoul of the military authorities in Saigon because of the on-air liberties he took with regard to matters of style and language and musical taste. [PAR] Basically, the premise of the movie is the same as that of practically every other military comedy ever made. Cronauer is like Hawkeye in Robert Altman's \"M*A*S*H\" or the Bill Murray character in \"Stripes.\" From the moment he eases his chair up to the microphone, all pretense of military decorum and respect for authority is abandoned. With the headphones slapped over his ears, Cronauer goes over the heads of his superiors and speaks directly to the soldiers. Instead of giving them soothing radio pablum, he shakes them up, ragging on the weather and the civilian authorities and giving voice to all the concerns of the men in the trenches. [PAR] This sounds like a first-rate subject for a comedy, and it is. But it goes wrong in ways that are maddeningly obvious. And most of the blame for bungling the film has to fall into director Barry Levinson's lap (with a portion reserved for screen writer Mitch Markowitz). But some of it has to go to Williams. [PAR] It's not that he's actually bad here. He gives Cronauer's radio monologues his usual caffeinated, channel-switching delivery, but he doesn't seem as relaxed and confident as he seemed in pictures like \"The Survivors\" and \"Moscow on the Hudson.\" He's pushing here -- as he did in \"Garp\" -- and at times, his face looks pinched from the exertion. [PAR] Also, the material itself -- some of which was scripted and some of which was mined from Williams' improvisations -- seems tired and lackluster: He's straining so hard partly because he's peddling stale goods. And because Williams, who's a kind of walking compendium of pop-culture references and whose comedy depends on being up to the minute, can allude only to events up to '65, it feels as if he's working with only half his brain. [PAR] At the same time, Williams' free-associative riffs seem whoppingly anachronistic. The attitudes toward gays, toward blacks, toward the war itself, come across as too hip for 1965. And so the film's perspective has a kind of faux hipness -- the hipness that comes with hindsight. [PAR] But if we don't think that Nixon jokes and teaching the Vietnamese how to cuss, American style, are riotously funny, not to worry. The function of the supporting cast -- which includes Forest Whitaker and Bruno Kirby -- is either to set up Cronauer's jokes or to laugh at them, and they do our laughing for us. [PAR] Once Levinson establishes that Cronauer is an embattled genius, the movie loses whatever starch it might have had. And after Cronauer is temporarily suspended for reporting a news story that hadn't first been screened by the military, the film's tone shifts from irreverent to serious and suddenly the\n\n\n### Answer:\nadrian </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

This Ferguside royal clan had rivalled the crown (of Dalriada, then that of Alba) against the Cen\u00e9l Loairn, the later House of Moray for the preceding four or more centuries. The Cen\u00e9l nGabr\u00e1in were represented by the so-called House of Alpin before Dunkeld. [PAR] Sir Iain Moncreiffe made the case that Cr\u00edn\u00e1n of Dunkeld actually belonged to a Scottish sept of Irish Cen\u00e9l Conaill royal dynasty.[1] This of course would not exclude his descendants from also being a (female line) continuation of the Cen\u00e9l nGabr\u00e1in through Beth\u00f3c. [PAR] Genealogically the Dunkeld dynasty is based on Duncan I of Scotland being of a different agnatic clan to his predecessor and maternal grandfather Malcolm II of Scotland. However, sociohistorically, the reign of Duncan's son Malcolm III of Scotland, which happens to coincide with the start of the centuries-long period of strong influence from the southern neighbour, the Kingdom of England, has been seen as a more important place to start.

The dynasty's patrilineal Breton ancestors had held the office of High Steward of Scotland since the 12th century, after arriving by way of Norman England. The royal Stewart line was founded by Robert II, and they were Kings and Queens of Scots from the late 14th century through the union with England in 1707.  Mary I, Queen of Scots was brought up in France, where she adopted the French spelling of the name, Stuart.  Her son, James VI of Scotland, inherited the thrones of England and Ireland upon the death of Elizabeth I in 1603.  Except for the period of the Commonwealth, 1649-1660, the Stuarts were monarchs of England, Scotland and Ireland until 1707; then of Great Britain and Ireland, to the death of Queen Anne in 1714. [PAR] In total, nine Stewart/Stuart monarchs ruled Scotland alone from 1371 until 1603. James VI of Scotland then inherited the realms of Elizabeth I of England, becoming James\u00a0I of England and Ireland in the Union of the Crowns. Following the Glorious Revolution in 1688, two Stuart queens ruled the isles: Mary II and Anne. Both were the Protestant daughters of James VII and II by his first wife.  Their father had converted to Catholicism and his new wife gave birth to a son in 1688, who would brought up a Roman Catholic and would precede his half-sisters; so James was deposed by Parliament in 1689, in favour of his daughters.  But neither had any children who survived to adulthood, so under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Act of Security 1704, the crown passed to the House of Hanover on the death of Queen Anne in 1714. [PAR] During the reign of the Stuarts, Scotland developed from a relatively poor and feudal country into a prosperous, modern and centralised state. They ruled during a time in European history of transition from the Middle Ages, through the Renaissance, to the midpoint of the Early modern period. Monarchs such as James IV were known for sponsoring exponents of the Northern Renaissance such as the poet Robert Henryson, and others.

The executive power of both the vice president and the president is granted under Article Two, Section One of the Constitution. The vice president is indirectly elected, together with the president, to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College.  The vice president is the first person in the presidential line of succession, and would normally ascend to the presidency upon the death, resignation, or removal of the president.   The Office of the Vice President of the United States assists and organizes the vice president's official functions. [PAR] The vice president is also president of the United States Senate  and in that capacity only votes when it is necessary to break a tie. While Senate customs have created supermajority rules that have diminished this constitutional tie-breaking authority, the vice president still retains the ability to influence legislation; for example, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 was passed in the Senate by a tie-breaking vice presidential vote.   Additionally, pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment, the vice president presides over the joint session of Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College. [PAR] While the vice president's only constitutionally prescribed functions aside from presidential succession relate to their role as President of the Senate, the office is commonly viewed as a component of the executive branch of the federal government. The United States Constitution does not expressly assign the office to any one branch, causing a dispute among scholars whether it belongs to the executive branch, the legislative branch, or both.   The modern view of the vice president as a member of the executive branch is due in part to the assignment of executive duties to the vice president by either the president or Congress, though such activities are only recent historical developments. [PAR] Origin [PAR] The creation of the office of vice president was a direct consequence of the creation of the Electoral College. Delegates to the Philadelphia Convention gave each state a number of presidential electors equal to that state's combined share of House and Senate seats. Yet the delegates were worried that each elector would only favor his own state's favorite son candidate, resulting in deadlocked elections that would produce no winners. To counter this potential difficulty, the delegates gave each presidential elector two votes, requiring that at least one of their votes be for a candidate from outside the elector's state; they also mandated that the winner of an election must obtain an absolute majority of the total number of electors. The delegates expected that each elector's second vote would go to a statesman of national character. [PAR] Fearing that electors might throw away their second vote to bolster their favorite son's chance of winning, however, the Philadelphia delegates specified that the runner-up would become vice president. Creating this new office imposed a political cost on discarded votes and forced electors to cast their second ballot. [PAR] Roles of the vice president [PAR] The Constitution limits the formal powers and role of vice president to becoming president,   should the president become unable to serve, prompting the well-known expression \"only a heartbeat away from the presidency,\" and to acting as the presiding officer of the U.S. Senate. [PAR] Other statutorily granted roles include membership of both the National Security Council and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.   [PAR] President of the United States Senate [PAR] As President of the Senate, the vice president has two primary duties: to cast a vote in the event of a Senate deadlock and to preside over and certify the official vote count of the U.S. Electoral College. For example, in the first half of 2001, the Senators were divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats and Dick Cheney's tie-breaking vote gave the Republicans the Senate majority. [PAR] Regular duties [PAR] As President of the Senate (Article I, Section 3, Clause 4), the vice president oversees procedural matters and may cast a tie-breaking vote.

Based on a paper copy of a membership list from PGI, he began pulling together like minded Floridians to form a fireworks club. As it turned out, Florida had some amazing pyrotechnic talent to pull from. Soon after forming, in August of 1992 at the annual PGI Festival, FPAG got into the Guinness Book of World Records for the largest Pyrotechnically driven wheel ever created. Not bad for a group only a year in existence. [PAR] The Shows FPAG Built [PAR] With all of the generous talent here in Florida, our members get to enjoy hand-built shows.

Although a box-office disappointment, it became popular with fans of traditional Hollywood musicals. [PAR] Camelot centres on England\u2019s reluctant, angst-ridden King Arthur (played by Richard Harris ), whose attempts to bring civility to his land are undermined by the love affair between his queen, Guenevere (played by Vanessa Redgrave ), and his most loyal knight, Lancelot (played by Franco Nero). The couple are eventually caught together, and though Arthur forgives them, he is forced to fight Lancelot. As the battle approaches, Arthur realizes that his hopes for Camelot are lost. [PAR] The film was based on a musical adapted from T.H. White \u2019s novel The Once and Future King (1958). Roundly criticized at the time of its release as overblown and overlong, Camelot was a major financial disappointment for Warner Brothers . Many critics complained that the production was too small in scope and that director Joshua Logan had a damaging obsession with close-ups. The leading actors, who originally had to contend with the memory of Richard Burton \u2019s and Robert Goulet\u2019s successful performances in the stage production, seem in retrospect perfectly suited to their roles. [PAR] Production notes and credits[DOC] [TLE] Camelot - Watch Turner Classic Movies on TCMCamelot [PAR] Camelot [PAR] Sunday February, 5 2017 at 10:30 AM [PAR] Films in BOLD will Air on TCM *\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 [PAR] VIEW TCMDb ENTRY [PAR] Notable for being the last film produced by Jack Warner for his famed studio, Camelot (1967) heralded the end of the big budget movie musical which would reach its nadir at the end of the decade with two disastrous flops, Star! (1968) and Paint Your Wagon (1969). Unlike those two films, however, Camelot struck a resonant chord with audiences who identified with its story of an idealistic ruler whose kingdom was destroyed by human greed, envy and jealousy. Certainly parallels were drawn between the musical's storyline and the Kennedy Administration which saw its empire collapse after the President was assassinated on a Dallas street in 1963. But more than anything, Camelot held a fascination for many viewers because of its mythic qualities; the story of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table is part of our literary culture and has inspired numerous plays, movies and books, the most significant being The Once and Future King by T. H. White, upon which Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Lowe based their stage musical, Camelot. [PAR] For director Joshua Logan, a film version of Camelot was an opportunity to correct the faults he found with the Broadway musical, despite its huge success. For one thing, he thought Richard Burton made a very distracted, absent-minded king and he felt that Julie Andrews was too wholesome as Guenevere whom he saw as a true femme fatale. The biggest problem for Logan though was the character of Lancelot, played by Robert Goulet on Broadway. In Logan's autobiography Movie Stars, Real People, and Me, he wrote that Lancelot is \"probably the most difficult part to play....Lancelot is French and has come across the Channel to espouse Arthur's passionate cause. He happens to be a holy young man who is able to perform miracles, including bringing back to life one of the knights he has killed in jousting. He does this by praying. And shortly thereafter he readily goes to bed with Arthur's wife. Lancelot is, so to speak, a holy cad. All of which makes him very difficult to play.\" Logan hoped to correct all these problems with his movie version but his biggest battle was convincing studio mogul Jack Warner to let him film it on location in Europe where castles and historic buildings from the period were still in abundance. Warner refused, demanding that the whole production be filmed on the Warners back lot. Through a strange quirk of fate, Warner soon relented his decision after receiving some tax loophole advice by his creative accounting department and gave Logan the\n\n\n### Answer:\nrichard harris </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] The judge ordered him to face the music immediately, citing his \"history of violence\" as he shipped the wild-eyed, big-haired Spector off to jail. [PAR] Spector's young, blond wife broke down in tears while Clarkson's mom, Donna, hugged Deputy District Attorney Alan Jackson . [PAR] A Bronx native who pioneered the \"Wall of Sound\" style of early 1960s rock 'n' roll and produced records for the Beatles , the Ramones and The Righteous Brothers , Spector faces a minimum of 18 years for the Feb. 3, 2003, slaying. [PAR] Spector, 69, fired a bullet in the mouth of Clarkson, 40, as she sat in the foyer of his castlelike mansion in Alhambra, Calif. His conviction came after a first trial in 2007 ended with a hung jury whose majority favored conviction. [PAR] The first jury deliberated for about 44 hours while the retrial jurors spent about 30 hours. [PAR] At both trials, which each lasted about six months, Spector's lawyers tried to convince jurors that Clarkson was despondent over a failed acting career and pointed the gun at her own face before pulling the trigger. [PAR] Prosecutors argued that the reclusive Spector murdered Clarkson when the blond beauty tried to flee his home before he was ready to say goodbye. [PAR] \"I feel relief for the family,\" Jackson said after the verdict. \"Today is when the Clarkson family gets their justice.\" [PAR] The Clarkson family is \"pleased with the verdict\" and that the jury \"rejected the distortion and trashing of Lana Clarkson's life,\" family spokesman John Taylor said. [PAR] But \"there's no joy here today,\" he said, standing next to Donna Clarkson . \"It's a tragedy.\" [PAR] Jackson called several former female acquaintances to testify that Spector had threatened them with guns in alcohol-fueled incidents eerily similar to the night Clarkson died. [PAR] Possibly the most damning evidence came from Spector's former chauffeur Adriano De Souza , who told jurors that Spector emerged from the mansion the night of Clarkson's death and said, \"I think I killed somebody\" as he held a bloody gun.[DOC] [TLE] Courting Phil Spector - Photo 1 - Pictures - CBS NewsCourting Phil Spector - Photo 1 - Pictures - CBS News [PAR] Courting Phil Spector [PAR] Next [PAR] After Phil Spector was convicted of second-degree murder on April 13, 2009, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept. took this booking photo of the music producer.

Bush [PAR] \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd [PAR] Andrew Jackson, the seventh US President (1829-1837), began life on March 15, 1767 in a log cabin on the frontier between the Carolinas. He was the first President not born of wealth, a fact that was not missed by the common people, who loved him. In addition to his presidency, Jackson was known for his military successes and for laying the groundwork for the modern Democratic Party. Because of his toughness and his fiery iron will, he was given the nickname \"Old Hickory.\" [PAR] Although he was known as a man of the people, Jackson believed in and promoted slavery and took millions of acres of land from Native Americans. In spite of his popularity, his policies did little to improve the lives of working Americans. [PAR] Jackson's father died days before his birth. One brother was killed in the Revolutionary War, while his other brother and mother died of smallpox. At the age of fourteen, Jackson was orphaned. His grandfather had left him an inheritance of $300, which Jackson used to study law. Later he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he began a practice. In 1791 he married Rachel Robards, who, although she thought she was divorced, was still married to someone else. The Jackson marriage was re-consecrated when Rachel's divorce was legal. [PAR] In 1796 Andrew Jackson was elected as Tennessee's delegate to the United States House of Representatives. The next year he was called upon to fill the unexpired term of his state's Senator. In 1798 he retired to private life, vowing never to return to politics. Within a few years he was appointed a state superior judge, and from 1804-1812 he worked on his plantation, the Hermitage, raising horses. He was known as a man with a fast temper and was often drawn into fights and duels, many of them over comments about the irregularity of his marriage. [PAR] In 1802 Jackson was a general of the Tennessee militia. Jackson fought in the Creek Indian Wars, during which he wrested twenty three million acres of land from tribal peoples. He was given the rank of major general by President Madison and commanded forces in the War of 1812. In 1815, with a mere 5,000 troops, he defeated a British force of 10,000 in the Battle of New Orleans, while sustaining only twenty losses. This was one of the worst British defeats in history, and it made Jackson a national hero. [PAR] In 1818, he led an attack against the Seminole Indians and captured Pensacola, involving the United States in conflicts with both Spain and Britain. Jackson claimed that the British were using the town as a base, and he executed two Englishmen for inciting the Indians. His success in Florida influenced Spain to sell the territory to the United States. [PAR] In 1819 John Quincy Adams completed the purchase of Florida, and in 1820, Jackson was appointed Governor. In 1823, he was elected Senator from Tennessee, and in 1824 the Tennessee legislature nominated Andrew Jackson for President. Although Jackson received the most votes, he lost the election. Because no candidate had received a majority of the votes, the contest was decided in the House of Representatives. John Quincy Adams was declared the winner amidst allegations that his Secretary of State, Henry Clay, had influenced the election in a \"corrupt bargain\". [PAR] After that unsuccessful bid, Jackson won the election of 1828 as a Democrat. He and Martin Van Buren were responsible for creating the political organization that was the basis for the modern Democratic Party. Andrew Jackson believed the presidency represented the will of the people, and, as such, should have broad authority. He was widely criticized for expanding the power of the presidency. He was known for rewarding his political supporters with government jobs. When reproached, he responded by claiming he was replacing aristocrats with the common man. It was Jackson who coined the phrase \"To the victor go the spoils,\" and thus the spoils system of politics was born.

Last year Sheridan Smith portrayed Mrs Ronnie Biggs for ITV, but what took them so long to get around to the Great Train Robbery itself? Just hours too long for the real Ronnie Biggs, as it happened. [PAR] Scripted by Chris Chibnall, a man basking in bankability following his bustin' hit series Broadchurch for ITV, this two-part voyage round the GTR is stylish, well cast and easy to watch, but adds nothing much to the existing information-mountain about the crime. You'd get more bang for your buck by digging out the 1967 movie Robbery, a thinly disguised version of the GTR story directed by Peter Bullitt Yates, while the depiction of the robbery itself doesn't differ greatly from the way they did it in Buster, the 1988 movie starring Phil Collins as train-robber Buster Edwards (nemesis awaits, pictured below). [PAR] This retelling has a bit of fun with cool Avengers-style mood music and Sixties-evoking split-screen graphics, though this leaves you wondering just how seriously you're supposed take it. In addition, Chibnall has introduced a slightly grating overlay of retrospective political awareness, with robbery mastermind Bruce Reynolds seemingly possessing a clairvoyant gift for anticipating the kind of sociological post-rationalisation later patented by John McVicar. In his more ponderous moments, Bruce isn't a mere career criminal but a man on a class war crusade, raising the consciousness of the light-fingered community. [PAR] Robbing the Royal Mail train en route from Glasgow to Euston isn't just a heist, it's \"one in the eye for all the old duffers running this country.\" When the police raise a mighty hue and cry in the aftermath of the robbery, and he hears that Tommy Butler has set up a special Flying Squad task force to hunt the raiders, Bruce declares that \"we kicked the Establishment up the arse, mate. The Establishment didn't like it\" (the Establishment didn't, of course, and the police and judiciary later had to admit that the original heavy sentences handed down to the robbers were excessive.) [PAR] But Bruce's street-fighting-man bravado doesn't quite square with his dismay when he discovers that instead of the million quid they anticipated stealing, they've netted a colossal \u00a32.6m. \"It wasn't supposed to be the crime of the bleedin' century!\" he protests, as though the Flying Squad would have sent them on their way with a jocular clip round the ear if they'd only stolen a modest \u00a31m. [PAR] Nonetheless, Luke Evans's portrayal of Reynolds is strong enough to make him the natural centre of gravity of the gang. He keeps the thuggish inclinations of some of his underlings in check with his gift for meticulous planning and clarity of thought, and it's not entirely his fault if the rug is pulled out from under them when the weak links in the chain fail to accomplish their assigned tasks (like burning down the gang's rural hideout, which was disastrously left intact with telltale fingerprints for the constabulary to find).\u00a0 [PAR] There's flavoursome support from Neil Maskell as Buster Edwards, Martin Compston as getaway driver Roy James and Jack Roth as Charlie Wilson (Compston and Maskell pictured above), and the thespometer will be cranked into the red in tonight's part two when\n\n\n### Answer:\nbuster edwards </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Characteristics unique to the beaver include a nictitating membrane, or a secondary internal, opaque inner eyelid, valvular ears and nose, and lips that close behind the incisors, thereby allowing a beaver to gnaw underwater. Large incisors are continuously growing and are kept at a manageable length by the gnawing action beaver use to procure food. Their rich, dense fur ranges in color from yellow-brown to almost black. Webbed hind feet serve to compliment the extraordinary swimming ability of the beaver, and the second hind toe has a split nail, purportedly for grooming purposes. [PAR] Although the beaver's tail is flat, primarily to aid in swimming and to navigate aquatic habitats, it serves other purposes as well. The tissue beneath the scaly outer layer, which is actually compressed, aggregated hairs, is highly vascularized at its base, and serves as a thermoregulatory tool. Blood is shunted from the surface of the tail, thereby minimizing heat loss. It also serves as a means for fat storage. [PAR] Habitat [PAR] Beaver rarely leave the water for any extended duration of time and can be found inhabiting wooded streams, the margins of lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, swamps and marshes, and many other sources of year-round water. Ideally, waterways will be of low gradient with an abundance of aspen, willow or alder, and a diversity of other woody and herbaceous vegetation. [PAR] Food and Feeding [PAR] The beaver's diet consists almost entirely of cellulose in the form of woody plant material. Woody plants are nearly indigestible to mammals, so digestion is aided by microorganisms inhabiting the small intestine. Beavers eat the leaves, bark and twigs of trees such as aspen, willow and red maple and a variety of herbaceous plants. During summer months, their dietary preferences may shift to aquatic vegetation including water lilies and rhizomes from shoreline ferns. [PAR] As winter draws near, beaver may collect and store or cache food items underwater near the entrance to their lodge in what is termed a 'raft' or 'feedpile' for use throughout the winter. This food store is imperative for survival when thick ice prevents access to fresh food during New York's long winters. [PAR] Behavior [PAR] Reproduction in beaver leads to the formation of their basic social unit, the family or colony. Beaver mate for life, but if one member of a pair dies, the remaining member will readily accept a new mate. These colonies usually consist of the parents, the present year's offspring, and often times there will be a representative from the previous year's litter. Infrequently an 'extra' adult will be found within a colony. As a colony grows, members may undoubtedly expand their breeding and foraging territories, building dams and lodges to support shelter requirements and expand home ranges. A typical number of beaver per colony is between four and six, but up to a dozen is possible. [PAR] Home ranges or colonial territories are established and passively defended by means of scent-mounding, where an adult beaver piles up muddy debris and mark the top with castoreum, which is washed out of the castor glands with urine. Active defense includes potentially violent encounters, as many beaver have been shown to bear the scars of territorial disputes, but such encounters seldom end in death. [PAR] Other forms of communication include vocalizations, postures and tail-slapping. Tail-slapping is thought to be a means for one beaver in a colony to warn other beaver of a potential threat. Another function may be to frighten would-be predators away. [PAR] Ecology [PAR] Like most rodents, beaver construct an elaborate den or lodge with multiple entrances. Beaver differ from other rodents not only in size, but the fact that beaver alter their surroundings to suit their needs.

[PAR] What does your heart do? [PAR] The purpose of your heart is to pump blood to the organs and tissues of your body that need the oxygen and nutrients it carries. Oxygen-rich blood is pumped out of the left side of your heart (shown on the right in the diagram) into the arteries to these tissues and organs. [PAR] Blood that has delivered its nutrients and oxygen and is in need of oxygen comes back to your heart in the veins and enters the right hand side of the heart (on left of diagram). This blood which is in need of oxygen (so-called deoxygenated blood) is sent to your lungs to pick up oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. [PAR] Your heart pumps all day to circulate blood around the body. On average, a red blood cell in the circulation will pass through the heart every 45 seconds. If you start to exert yourself your heart will start to pump faster to supply your working muscles with the increased amount of oxygen and nutrients they need. The heart is a muscle too, and to enable it to pump effectively, it has its own blood supply bringing it oxygen. [PAR] How does your heart work? [PAR] Your heart is made up of 2 pumps. The pump on the right hand side receives blood that has already delivered its oxygen round the body and sends this blood to the lungs to pick up more oxygen (and get rid of carbon dioxide). [PAR] The pump on the left hand side receives oxygen-rich blood and then pumps it out into the arteries to deliver its oxygen around the body. [PAR] Blood in need of oxygen enters heart [PAR] Blood in need of oxygen from around the body travels in the veins to the heart. This blood in need of oxygen (also called deoxygenated blood) is usually shown as blue or purple on diagrams. [PAR] This \u2018deoxygenated\u2019 blood enters the top right hand side chamber (shown on left in diagram) of the heart, which is called the right atrium, via two large veins. Blood from the upper body, e.g. the head and arms, comes in via the superior vena cava. Blood from the lower body, that is the trunk and legs, comes in via the inferior vena cava. [PAR] Blood passes from right atrium to right ventricle [PAR] When the right atrium fills, the blood then passes through a one-way door (valve) called the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. The valve stops blood from flowing backwards into the right atrium once it\u2019s in the right ventricle. The right ventricle relaxes and venous blood in need of oxygen flows in. [PAR] Right ventricle sends blood needing oxygen to the lungs [PAR] The blood needing oxygen is pumped out of the right ventricle, through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery then divides into the right and left pulmonary arteries, carrying blood to the right and left lungs. In the lungs the blood gives up its carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. [PAR] Oxygen-rich blood from lungs enters heart [PAR] Fresh blood full of oxygen leaves the lungs and comes back to the heart in the pulmonary veins. This oxygen-rich blood enters the left atrium \u2014 the top left chamber of the heart (on right of diagram). [PAR] Blood passes from left atrium to left ventricle [PAR] When the left atrium is full it pushes the blood through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. [PAR] Left ventricle sends oxygen-rich blood around body [PAR] The left ventricle relaxes and fills up with blood before squeezing and pumping the oxygen-rich blood through the aortic valve into the aorta \u2014 the main artery that carries blood to your body. The muscle wall of the left ventricle is very thick because it has to pump blood around the whole body.

It soon became clear that large profits could be made by building railways. A group of businessmen led by James Sandars recruited George Stephenson to build them a railway. The main objective was to reduce the costs of transporting raw materials and finished goods between Manchester , the centre of the textile industry and Liverpool , the most important port in the north of England. [PAR] The proposed Liverpool & Manchester Railway was a serious economic threat to the Bridgewater Canal. that was making a fortune by shipping goods between Liverpool and Manchester. In 1825 shares in the company, originally purchased at \u00a370, were selling at \u00a31,250 and paying an annual dividend of \u00a335. The Marquis of Stafford, who became the principal owner of the canal after the death of the Duke of Bridgewater, was making an annual profit of \u00a3100,000 from the venture, and unstandably led the fight against the planned railway. Turnpike Trusts, coach companies and farmers also voiced their opposition. [PAR] After the House of Commons rejected Stephenson's proposed route, James Sandars recruited a company run by George Rennie to carry out a new survey and were invited by the company to build it. However, they refused to work with George Stephenson , who they did not consider was a real engineer, and they lost the contract. [PAR] After several years of debate, Parliament gave permission for the Manchester & Liverpool Railway to be built in 1826. George Stephenson was faced with a large number of serious engineering problems. This included crossing the unstable peat bog of Chat Moss , a nine-arched viaduct across the Sankey Valley and a two-mile long rock cutting at Olive Mount . [PAR] The Liverpool & Manchester railway was 31 miles long and consisted of a double line of rails of the fish-bellied type and laid on stone or timber sleepers. Passenger trains started at the Crown Street Station in Liverpool and after passing Moorish Arch at Edge Hill terminated at Water Street in Manchester . [PAR] The directors of the Liverpool & Manchester company were unsure whether to use locomotives or stationary engines on their line. To help them reach a decision, it was decided to hold a competition where the winning locomotive would be awarded \u00a3500. The idea being that if the locomotive was good enough, it would be the one used on the new railway. [PAR] The competition was held at Rainhill during October 1829. Each competing locomotive had to haul a load of three times its own weight at a speed of at least 10 mph. The locomotives had to run twenty times up and down the track at Rainhill which made the distance roughly equivalent to a return trip between Liverpool and Manchester . Afraid that heavy locomotives would break the rails, only machines that weighed less than six tons could compete in the competition. Ten locomotives were originally entered for the Rainhill Trials but only five turned up and two of these were withdrawn because of mechanical problems. Sans Pareil and Novelty did well but it was the Rocket , produced by George and his son, Robert Stephenson , that won the competition. [PAR] Entrance to Water Street Station, Manchester [PAR] The Liverpool & Manchester railway was opened on 15th September, 1830. The prime minister, the Duke of Wellington , and a large number of important people attended the opening ceremony that included a procession of eight locomotives, including the Northumbrian , the Rocket , the North Star and the Phoenix. [PAR] After the group of special visitors were given a ride on the Northumbrian , William Huskisson , one of Liverpool's MPs crossed from his own carriage to speak to the Duke of Wellington .

Trendle was a Detroit, Michigan lawyer who had established a reputation as a tough negotiator, specializing in movie contracts and leases. [PAR] Trendle became involved in the Detroit area entertainment business in 1928, when local motion picture theater owner John H. Kunsky offered Trendle 25 per cent ownership in exchange for his services. [PAR] Kunsky had been an early investor in Nickelodeons beginning in 1905. In 1911, he built the first movie theater in Detroit. It was the second movie theater in the nation. By 1928, he owned twenty movie theaters, including four of the largest first-run theaters in Detroit. [PAR] Kunsky was being driven out of the theater business, when Adolph Zukor acquired the Detroit area film exchange known as the Cooperative Booking Office and began pressuring local theater owners to sell out to Paramount. Trendle negotiated to sell Kunsky's theatres for six million dollars. Zukor transferred the theaters to a Paramount subsidiary named United Detroit Theatres. In 1948, Paramount's monopoly became the focus of an antitrust suit initiated by the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers (SIMPP). [PAR] As part of the deal, Trendle and Kunsky were required never to reenter the movie business in Detroit. [PAR] However, Zukor apparently recognized Trendle's talents and hired him to manage the Paramount theaters in Detroit. Trendle is credited as \"having built\" the historic Alger Theater which opened August 22, 1935 on Detroit's east side. Trendle was fired from the United Detroit Theatres for \"negligence\" in 1937. [PAR] Radio and television stations [PAR] Edit [PAR] Trendle and Kunsky formed the Kunsky-Trendle Broadcasting Company in 1929, after purchasing Detroit radio station WGHP. The radio station's call letters were changed to WXYZ . [PAR] Trendle was the President and Kunsky was the Vice President of the company. Trendle was active as the station manager. Kunsky is rarely mentioned, except as co-owner. [PAR] WXYZ was initially affiliated with the Columbia Broadcasting System but became an independent station within a year. Trendle's partner Kunsky legally changed his name to King in 1936 and the 'Kunsky-Trendle Broadcasting Company' became the 'King-Trendle Broadcasting Company'. [PAR] In 1931, Kunsky-Trendle acquired WASH and WOOD in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The two stations merged facilities, including studios and transmitters but retained both station licenses. WASH was on the air from 8am to Noon, and WOOD from Noon to Midnight. WOOD-WASH became an NBC Red affiliate in 1935. King and Trendle decided to drop the WASH license in 1942, keeping the WOOD identification. [PAR] In 1946, the newly formed American Broadcasting Company purchased the King-Trendle Broadcasting Company and its radio stations for $ 3.65 million dollars. This sale was for the broadcast facilities (including WOOD, WXYZ and the Michigan Regional Network), but did not include ownership of Trendle's radio programs. The FCC approved ABC's purchase on July 18, 1946. In 1952, Paramount Theaters (owners of Kunsky and Trendle's former chain of Detroit area theaters) acquired ABC, including WXYZ. [PAR] Trendle entered into a new partnership with long term business associates H. Allen Campbell and Raymond Meurer. The Trendle-Campbell Broadcasting Company was formed in 1946 and started radio station WTCB in Flint, Michigan. The new radio station went on the air April 26, 1946 with a four tower 1000 watt broadcast array. The call letters were later changed to WTAC. In 1953, they added UHF television station WTAC-TV affiliated with ABC TV and DuMont. The TV station went out of business less than a year later because too few TVs at the time were equipped to receive UHF channels. The radio station has changed owners several times and its call sign was changed to WSNL in 1997. The station is currently owned by The Christian Broadcasting System.

[PAR] hair and fur are the same thing essentially - keratin, dead cells, protein etc that grows out of follicles. Dunno about in taxidermy terms - but in biology, a siginifacnt difference between the two is that 'fur' is the common name applied when multiple hairs erupt from asingle follicle, whilst 'hair' is when a single hair erupts from a follicle. You wanted an example of a mammal that does not have 'fur'? Humans. Our follicles produce a single hair each. [PAR] Like Glen pointed out - Birds are warm blooded. So while Mammals have warm blood - it is not an exclusive characteristic to them alone. [PAR] Also non exclusive is the live birth thing which many associate with being mammalian, as some mammals (monotremes) do not give birth to live young.

I watch a lot of movies\u2014they are my escape from an urban reality that often weighs too heavily on my primate brain.  Long ago I relegated Disney to that shelf of the least profound films.  Although many of their animated features of the past decade or so have introduced complexities and some seriousness into the mix, often I find myself still hungry after sitting through a helping of the Disney fantasy-land.  It seems to me that nature is crueler and more careless than Disney makes it out to be.  Nevertheless, sometimes something profound can be discovered in the most unlikely of places. [PAR] I never saw Mary Poppins until I was in college, but now I come back to it as an adult from time to time and I still learn from it.  While watching recently it struck me that two worlds (at least) are juxtaposed here: the world of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral and the Dawes Tomes Mousley Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank.  On the night before the Banks children accompany their father to the bank, Mary Poppins suggests that some things are important, although quite small.  She refers, of course, to the birds that the Bird Lady uses to make her pitiful living.  She sells crumbs within sight of an opulent bank that stands for the order of society.  She is dressed in poor clothing, a beggar woman under the protective gaze of saint and apostles.  The bank has guards and bars and powerful men.  The worlds are brought into collision by Jane and Michael wanting to feed the birds but they instead are forced to open a bank account.  In the ensuing melee, George Banks takes the blame and is fired. [PAR] On his way to the bank that night to be sacked, he reevaluates.  In a brief but significant scene, he pauses in front of the Cathedral, deserted at night, and scans where the Bird Lady sat.  The scene immediately cuts to the bank, still at work, its great doors snapped open by uniformed guards.  The Cathedral, dark and glowering, is just down the street.  And yet, once dismissed Mr. Banks chooses the way of the Bird Lady, an unemployed man spending tuppence for paper and string to mend a kite.  No, I don\u2019t attribute much profundity to Disney, but Mary Poppins does give pause for a moment.  We never see the inside of the Cathedral.  It is generally dark and forbidding.  The bank is light and inviting, yet liable to turn on you.

He also may be considered the unluckiest player in FA Cup history. [PAR] On this day 55 years ago, on January 28, 1961, Law scored six goals for Manchester City in a Fourth Round tie against second-tier Luton Town\u2026 and still ended up on the losing side. [PAR] Playing under torrential rain and in ankle-deep mud, Law had managed to score all of City\u2019s goals when the game was abandoned in the 69th minute due to the waterlogged pitch. The scoreline was subsequently wiped and the game rescheduled to start anew four days later. [PAR] \"At the time, I was fairly relaxed about it,\" Law told the BBC Sport many years later. \"I was only young. I just thought, it doesn\u2019t matter, we will beat them in the second game anyway.\" [PAR] As it turned out, Law did score again in the replay, but this time City lost, 3-1.\u00a0 [PAR] Ouch! [PAR] \"I never scored six in a game after that,\" Law recalled. \"The most I got was four, when I was at Manchester United. The only time I scored six was in a five-a-side game after I retired.\" [PAR] \"Obviously it wasn\u2019t meant to be. The funny thing was when we went for the replay on the Wednesday the pitch was in a worse state than it ever was on Saturday!\" [PAR] Adding insult to injury, Law\u2019s six goals were of wiped off the record books as well, eventually costing him the record for most FA Cup goals in the 20th century. The 1964 Ballon d\u2019Or winner finished his career with 41 FA Cup goals, three shy of Ian Rush\u2019s mark of 44. [PAR] There was just one silver lining: Law would go on to win the competition just two seasons later with Manchester United. His contribution to the FA Cup run: six goals in six games. Of course.

[PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Print this story [PAR] Harold Shipman, the former doctor who is said to have murdered over 250 people while practising, was found dead in his prison cell on this day in 2004. [PAR] He had hanged himself by tying a bed sheet around the bars of the cell at Wakefield Prison. Shipman had been taken off \u2018suicide watch\u2019 18 months earlier while at Frankland prison, near Durham. [PAR] His wife Primrose was due to visit him the following day \u2013 his 58th birthday \u2013 and had spoken to him the night before, when she had found him to be behaving normally. [PAR] Nevertheless, the jury at the inquest into his death would find that he had killed himself as he was in despair at the thought of being incarcerated, and because he had established that his wife would be entitled to an NHS pension if he died before the age of 60. [PAR] The jury found that Shipman was \"neither bullied nor goaded\" into taking his own life. A pathologist told the inquest that Shipman had not been attacked or murdered, and ruled out the possibility that the suicide was an accident. [PAR] Shipman was jailed for life in January 2000 for murdering 15 patients, the victims dying from lethal injections he administered. The Shipman enquiry established that he almost certainly killed 200 others, and had a \u2018real suspicion\u2019 that he was responsible for 45 more. [PAR] The former GP maintained his innocence throughout, always insisting that he had simply administered pain-relief, and had been planning an appeal against his conviction before his death. [PAR] What did you make of Harold Shipman\u2019s suicide? Did you live in the area where he practised? Let us know in the Comments section below. [PAR] Harold Shipman - Did you know? [PAR] Harold Shipman saw his mother die of lung cancer when he was 17 years old. In the late stages of her life, she was administered pain-killing morphine at home by her own doctor, in a manner that Shipman\u2019s murders would later emulate. [PAR] It is now believed that Shipman killed patients from his very earliest days as a GP, when working in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. He moved to Hyde, Greater Manchester, eventually becoming a sole practitioner in 1993. [PAR] He was first investigated in early 1998 due to the large numbers of cremations of his patients he was requesting authorisation for. The investigation foundered, and Shipman murdered three more patients before he was finally arrested. [PAR] Shipman was caught when he forged a will in the name of his final victim, Kathleen Grundy, which excluded her lawyer daughter and grandchildren but left him a sum of \u00a3386,000. [PAR] He was tried and convicted for the murders of 15 patients between 1995 and 1998; the Shipman Inquiry, chaired by Dame Janet Smith, found that he had killed on at least 200 other occasions. [PAR] While in prison, Shipman liked to play Scrabble, joined a card school and was writing a biography of Napoleon. He signed up to an English literature course and studied the peninsular wars. [PAR] Primrose Shipman said she had had a \"two-minute\" conversation with her husband about suicide while he was on remand at Strangeways prison in Manchester in 1999. On asking if he was suicidal, he had answered \"no\" and promised to talk to her about it if he did. [PAR] Shipman remains the only British doctor to be convicted of murdering his patients.

Located in Canaima National Park, the second largest national park in Venezuela, the waterfall tumbles from a cleft near the summit of table top mountain Auy\u00e1n-tepu into what is known as Devil\u2019s Canyon, 3212 feet (979m) below. The falls are a tributary of the Carrao River, itself part of Venezuela\u2019s Orinoco River system. Considered among the world\u2019s most dazzling natural wonders, Angel Falls are a truly unforgettable spectacle. [PAR] History of Angel Falls [PAR] Before the mid-1950s, the falls were an unknown wonder. Even the indigenous Kamarakotos P\u00f3mon tribe who occupied the valley beside Auy\u00e1n-tepu stayed away, believing that Angel Falls\u2019 remote location harboured malign spirits. [PAR] In 1933, air-borne American gold prospector James Crawford (\u2018Jimmie\u2019) Angel discovered Angel Falls accidentally, flying over the mountain in his Flamingo monoplane while in search of a valuable ore bed. [PAR] In 1937, Jimmie returned to the falls, his second wife, Marie, and acquaintances Gustavo Henry and Miguel Delgado also aboard his jittery, fixed-wing plane. [PAR] Although Jimmie landed his plane successfully on Auy\u00e1n-tepu\u2019s heart-shaped summit, the plane\u2019s wheels became submerged in mud, and Jimmie\u2019s aircraft remained marooned atop the mountain until 1970. [PAR] For 11 days, the group trekked across rough terrain, having to ration their limited food supplies, until they reached a small settlement at Kamarata. Word spread of Jimmie\u2019s exploits and the falls\u2019 were duly named after him. The tale piqued international interest in Angel Falls and many scientific investigations followed. [PAR] Canaima National Park was founded in 1962. In 1994, UNESCO named it a World Heritage Site. [PAR] Visiting Angel Falls [PAR] Canaima National Park, with its breath-taking variety of tropical wildlife an awe-inspiring vistas, is the gateway to Angel Falls. The UNESCO World Heritage Site is only accessible by air; there are no overland routes into the park. [PAR] Rutaca and Avior airlines provide flights to and from the airstrip at Canaima camp. Passengers fly over dense swathes of deep jungle, much of which remains untouched by man, as well as ancient mountains, and many snaking rivers. [PAR] Before flying out, travellers must prove that they have been vaccinated against yellow fever. Visitors to the park generally fly from the colonial town of Ciudad Bolivar or Venezuela\u2019s capital, Caracas. (It is also possible, though costly, to charter a private plane.) [PAR] Upon arriving at Canaima camp, an entry fee of approximately $4 is levied. Situated roughly 50 kilometres from Angel Falls, the Canaima camp is framed by several (lower altitude) waterfalls, which flow into a beautiful, mineral-stained lagoon edged by sandy beaches. Excursions to Angel Falls proceed from the camp, while tourist accommodation is situated a short Jeep ride away. [PAR] Having reached the park, a popular way to get to Angel Falls is by boat, though visitors can also fly from Canaima airstrip to Canaima lagoon. Motorised canoes travel upstream between May and January. Journey times vary, though, on average, it takes about five hours to reach the falls from camp. Winding waterways, edged with dense forest, teem with exotic wildlife; canoes zoom over boulders through rapidly flowing sections of river and those on-board are liable to get wet. From the lagoon, visitors then trek through lush, Venezuelan jungle, to various viewing points. If the flow of the falls is gentle enough, tourists are encouraged to swim in pools formed by the plummeting water. [PAR] Trips to Angel Falls can be booked in advance through various tour operators. Park lodges also run scheduled trips that can be booked upon your arrival at Canaima camp. [PAR] Fetching directions......

Gjetost cheese, pronounced \"YAY-toast\" by Americans or \"yed-OOST\" by Scandinavians, is also known as Brunost cheese. Gjetost is a brown Norwegian cheese made of goat's milk or a blend of goat and cow's milk. Gjetost Cheese from Norway is produced by slowly heating a vat of whey, cream and milk. This is why Gjetost is sometimes called a whey cheese.  The caramel brown color of Gjetost Cheese is a result of the caramelization of the milk's sugars during this heating process. [PAR] Gjetost Cheese History [PAR] Gjetost Cheese originated in the Gudbrandsdalen valley of Norway over one hundred years ago. Gjetost has always been sweet like butterscotch with a dense, rich texture.  Gjetost is formed into rindless squares or cylinders, and is best when sliced wafer thin and enjoyed open-faced on Norwegian flatbread served with fresh fruit.  It is no wonder children are drawn the taste of this unique, sweet-like-fudge cheese.  Often enjoyed as a breakfast cheese in Norway, Gjetost also makes an excellent snack and is the perfect dessert cheese. [PAR] This unique Norwegian brown cheese is also known as Brunost, which is simply Norwegian for Brown Cheese. The Ski Queen variety is a blend of cow and goat's milk, whereas the Ekte Gjetost Cheese from Norway is made from 100% goat's milk.  Gjetost is packed with energy and is extremely tolerant of temperature fluctuations. Because of these benefits, Gjetost is a preferred snack for Norwegians skiiers, who pack it in their backpacks and snack on it while on the trails. This is where the Ski Queen brand name comes from, and may be one of the secrets to the international success of Norwegian cross-country skiiers.

Gjetost is as sweet as caramel, with the texture of a dense, buttery fudge. [PAR] Gjetost is a variety of Scandinavian brown cheese (brunost), often refered to as Ski cheese or Ski Queen. [PAR] Like ricotta, Gjetost comes from whey-- that is, the liquid by-product of cheesemaking. But while ricotta is fresh, ready in a matter of minutes, Gjetost is a time-consuming process which requires slow and continuous heating of whey, cream, and milk. Over many hours, the milk sugars are cooked to the point of caramelization. Its colour and unique taste are the product of the natural caramelization of the sugar in milk (lactose) that occurs during the cheese's production process. Gjetost is a concentrated, sweet block that tastes more like butterscotch than like actual cheese. [PAR] The thick but almost spreadable consistency of Gjetost lends itself well to anything crisp and crunchy, be it crackers, toasted bread, or thinly sliced apples and pears.

Abstract [PAR] The Cordillera del Condor has been the site of armed disputes between the Peru and Ecuador for over one hundred and fifty years. Despite claims that the land is part of Ecuador, the area of confrontation is \"recognized as Peruvian by the 1942 Rio Protocol, the 1945 arbitration decision, the 1947 U.S. Air Force aerial survey, and the documents issued after the 1981 border conflict.\" [PAR] 2. Description [PAR] The common border between Ecuador and Peru has been the source of conflict for over the past 150 years, and the conflict re- ignited in January of 1995. The crisis began because of a poorly defined peace agreement between the two countries in 1942. The Rio Protocol, as it was called, took some 200,000 square kilometers of land from Ecuador and gave it to Peru. The poor description of the new frontier left come 100,00 square kilometers of the border unmarked when an unknown river appeared where the mountains were supposed to be. These rivers are the Santiago and Zamora and are located in the middle of the dense jungle between the two countries. As a result of the lack of clarity of the Rio Protocol, the two nations have been fighting on and off for the last fifty years, including two full scale wars and spasmodic frontier incidents. [PAR] The populations of Peru and Ecuador are accustomed to periodic threats and minor skirmishes on the Condor Cordillera (Financial Times, Jan. 1995). January 29, however, is the anniversary of the treaty signed in 1942 that gave almost half of Ecuador to Peru. Tensions always rise during this time, but in 1995 they hit a 14- year peak (New York Times, Feb., 1995). This time, however, clashes erupted. Ecuador's President Sixto Duran Ballen proclaimed a state of national emergency and called up the reserves. Peru responded by mobilizing thousands of troops and massing them in the border area of Timbles. Ecuadorian officials maintained that Peru was attacking territory that was under Ecuadorian control for decades and was outside the area of dispute (Ibid). [PAR] Ecuador's armed forces also accused the Peruvians of using CH-47 Chinook and Bell-212 helicopters, which they say were provided by the US to aid in Peruvian drug fighting efforts. Two Peruvian airlines suspended flights to Quito, the capital of Ecuador (The Commercial Appeal, Jan. 1995). [PAR] Each side accused the other of provoking the conflict and insisted it was a peace-seeking nation which is honor-bound to defend its sovereignty and national territory. The core of the dispute - dating back to the earliest independence period - lies in the exact position of the border. [PAR] Land squabbles have surrounded bilateral relations for more than 150 years. The disputes between Peru and Ecuador began during the time of the Incas when the Incas from Cuzco, Peru conquered the kingdom of Quito, Ecuador. In 1535, a mission was sent from Quito to mark the border with Peru. Ecuador claims that the first expeditions were dispatched from Quito and that the Jesuits from there set up the first missions. Peru argues that an expedition from Lima discovered the Amazon. In 1802, the Spanish crown gave title over the region to the viceroyalty of Lima, taking it from that of New Granada, which included modern-day Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. The Ecuadorian historians have interpreted a subsequent ruling in 1819 as reversing that decision. The dispute has lasted for hundreds of years since. [PAR] The last major conflict was in 1941 when Peru invaded Ecuador. A ten-day war ensued, ending with a the signing of the so-called Rio de Janeiro Protocol, which defined the border between the two countries. Congresses of both Peru and Ecuador ratified the treaty and four countries - the US, Brazil, Chile and Argentina accepted the task of being its 'guarantors.' [PAR] Mapping the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border was completed in early 1947 by the US air force. Boundary markers were established along some 1600 km of frontier, but 78km in the Condor Cordillera stretch, east of the city Zamora, remained unmarked.

[PAR] And the fact that it has been named after St Jude - the patron saint of lost causes - isn't exactly reassuring. [PAR] We've been told to expect winds of up to 90mph, torrential rain, travel chaos and possible disruptions to the power supply , so perhaps we should start to despair. [PAR] But Monday also happens to be the feast day for this particular saint, so it might not be all bad news. [PAR] So who was St Jude? Here are the 10 things you need to know about the patron saint of lost causes and desperate cases... [PAR] 1. St Jude was one of Jesus' 12 apostles, chosen to spread the word of the gospel. [PAR] 2. He was also known as Thaddeus or Thaddaeus - said to be a surname for the name Labbaeus which means \"heart\" or courageous\". [PAR] 3. He is believed to have written the book of Jude. Religious scholars say it contains some of the finest expressions of praise to God in the Bible's New Testament. [PAR] 4. Jude became associated with desperate situations because of a letter he wrote to the Churches of the East. In it he says that the faithful must keep going even in harsh or difficult circumstances. [PAR] 5. He is thought to have been martyred in Beirut in around 65 AD, along with fellow apostle Simon the Zealot. He is often depicted showing a club or axe, symbolising the way he died. [PAR] 6. He is also sometimes pictured with a flame above his head. This refers to the Pentecost, where he and the other apostles received the Holy Spirit. [PAR] 7. The personal ads sections of some newspapers occasionally include messages from people calling on St Jude for help in times of need, or thanking him for his support and guidance. [PAR] 8. Some choose to carry the image of St Jude on a medal or as a pendant on a necklace to provide comfort. [PAR] 9. The Shrine of St Jude can be found at the parish church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Faversham, Kent. It was set up in the 1950s by the church's friars, who noticed they were getting an increasing number of requests for St Jude prayer cards. Donations to \"The Shrine of St Jude\" began to come in, but one didn't exist - so Friar Elias Lynch set one up. The shrine is visited all year round, but particularly on St Jude's feast day - October 28. [PAR] 10. St Jude is not to be confused with Judas Iscariot - another of the 12 apostles, but the one who betrayed Jesus.[DOC] [TLE] Patron Saint of Lost Causes - Lucky MojoLucky W Amulet Archive: Good Luck Charms, Magic Talismans, Protection Amulets [PAR] SPIRITUAL  SUPPLIES [PAR] in HOODOO and CONJURE [PAR] The Apostle Saint Jude Thaddeus is \"The Miraculous Saint,\" the Catholic Patron Saint of \"lost causes\" and \"cases despaired of.\"When all other avenues are closed, he is the one to call upon, and his help often comes at the last moment. [PAR] Dressed in green and white Biblical-era clothing -- for he was one of the Disciples of Jesus -- he is distinguished by the fact that he often wears and holds a golden metal pendant of the type carried by people seeking his aid. Additionally, in some images of Saint Jude, there is a small flame atop his head, signifying the Baptism by Fire (also known as the Baptism of the Holy Ghost) which was received by the Disciples of Jesus at Pentecost.\n\n\n### Answer:\npatron saint of lost causes </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Looney Tunes series of cartoons. [PAR] History [PAR] Robert McKimson introduced Hippety Hopper in Hop, Look and Listen (1948), which created the mold into which future Hippety Hopper cartoons would fall: baby kangaroo Hopper escapes from the zoo, the circus, etc., and is mistaken for a giant mouse by Sylvester the cat. Sylvester then\u00a0tries to capture and eat his \"prey\", but the innocent and infantile Hippety mistakes Sylvester's predations for a game \u2014 a game of rough-housing, to be exact. Sylvester is repeatedly punched, kicked, juggled, spun, and pounced, but each failure only cements his will to have the \"mouse\" for lunch. The cat's dignity will suffer no less. [PAR] After Hippety Hopper (1949), the first cartoon where the character is officially named, the character would later return in McKimson's Pop 'Im Pop! (1950) in which proud papa Sylvester boasts of his mousing skills to his son, Sylvester Junior . Also in 1950, Hippety made a cameo in the Bugs Bunny cartoon Bushy Hare , which is the only time he talks. [PAR] In Cat's A-Weigh , (1953) Sylvester accepts a position as mouse-catcher on a ship. He encounters Hippety Hopper being shipped from Australia. Sylvester mistakes Hippety Hopper once again for a giant mouse, and the baby kangaroo promptly beats the cat to a pulp. Junior is mortified, but the true victim is Sylvester, humiliated by a mere \"mouse\" in front of his own son. [PAR] Mckimson would continue the Sylvester/Hippety Hopper series for 16 years, varying it slightly from cartoon to cartoon. In Bell Hoppy (1954), for example, Sylvester must hang a bell around a mouse's neck in order to join the \"Loyal Order of Alley Cats and Mousing and Chowder Club.\" [PAR] In Lighthouse Mouse , Sylvester must guard a lighthouse from the baby kangaroo who wants nothing more than to turn it off. Hoppy Go Lucky (1952) was a parody of Of Mice and Men, with Sylvester accompanied by the giant, simple-minded cat named \"Benny\" who wants a mouse to \"hug and pet.\" The central theme is always the same: Sylvester is shamed for his failure to capture a simple \"mouse\". [PAR] The Hippety Hopper/Sylvester cartoons ended in 1964 when the Warner Bros. studio closed its animation unit, with Freudy Cat as Hippety's final appearance. The character continues to appear in Looney Tunes marketing and other projects, such as some cameo appearances in the crowd shots of the 1996 film Space Jam and the very end of the 2003 movie, Looney Tunes: Back in Action . In an episode of The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries set in Australia, Sylvester stumbles into a group of baby kangaroos, who all resemble Hippety, and comments that this is the first time he had seen the \"giant mice\" for years.

Leaving her native Caen for Paris, she had planned to kill Marat at the Bastille Day parade on July 14 but was forced to seek him out in his home when the festivities were canceled.

In addition to the income from the fur business, both of Henie's parents had inherited wealth. Wilhelm Henie had been a one-time World Cycling Champion and the Henie children were encouraged to take up a variety of sports at a young age. Henie initially showed talent at skiing , and then followed her older brother Leif to take up figure skating . As a girl, Henie was also a nationally ranked tennis player and a skilled swimmer and equestrienne . Once Henie began serious training as a figure skater, her formal schooling ended. She was educated by tutors, and her father hired the best experts in the world, including the famous Russian ballerina Tamara Karsavina, to transform his daughter into a sporting celebrity. [2] [PAR] Competitive career [PAR] Edit [PAR] Henie won her first major competition, the senior Norwegian championships, at the age of 10. She then placed eighth in a field of eight at the 1924 Winter Olympics , at the age of eleven. During the 1924 program, she skated over to the side of the rink several times to ask her coach for directions. But by the next Olympiad, she needed no such assistance. [PAR] Henie won the first of an unprecedented ten consecutive World Figure Skating Championships in 1927 at the age of fourteen. The results of 1927 World Championships, where Henie won in 3\u20132 decision (or 7 vs. 8 ordinal points) over the defending Olympic and World Champion Herma Szabo of Austria , was controversial, as all three of five judges that gave Henie first-place ordinals were Norwegian (1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7 points) while Szabo received first-place ordinals from an Austrian and a German Judge (1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 points). Henie went on to win first of her three Olympic gold medals the following year. She defended her Olympic titles in 1932 and in 1936, and her World titles annually until 1936. She also won six consecutive European championships from 1931 to 1936. Henie's unprecedented three Olympic gold medals haven't been matched by any ladies single skater since; neither are her achievements as ten-time consecutive World Champion. While Irina Slutskaya of Russia won her seventh European Championship in 2006 to become the most successful ladies skater in European Championships, Henie retains record of most consecutive titles, sharing it with Katarina Witt of Eastern Germany / Germany (1983\u20131988). [PAR] Towards the end of her career, she began to be strongly challenged by younger skaters including Cecilia Colledge , Megan Taylor and Hedy Stenuf . However, she held off these competitors and went on to win her third Olympic title at the 1936 Winter Olympics , albeit in very controversial circumstances with Cecilia Colledge finishing a very close second. Indeed, after the school figures section at the 1936 Olympic competition, Colledge and Henie were virtually neck and neck with Colledge trailing by just a few points.

Kennedy, is shot to death by Jack Ruby, a Dallas nightclub owner. [PAR] On November 22, President Kennedy was fatally shot while riding in an open-car motorcade through the streets of downtown Dallas. Less than an hour after the shooting, Lee Harvey Oswald killed a policeman who questioned him on the street. Thirty minutes after that, he was arrested in a movie theater by police. Oswald was formally arraigned on November 23 for the murders of President Kennedy and Officer J.D. Tippit. [PAR] On November 24, Oswald was brought to the basement of the Dallas police headquarters on his way to a more secure county jail. A crowd of police and press with live television cameras rolling gathered to witness his departure. As Oswald came into the room, Jack Ruby emerged from the crowd and fatally wounded him with a single shot from a concealed .38 revolver. Ruby, who was immediately detained, claimed that rage at Kennedy\u2019s murder was the motive for his action. Some called him a hero, but he was nonetheless charged with first-degree murder. [PAR] Jack Ruby, originally known as Jacob Rubenstein, operated strip joints and dance halls in Dallas and had minor connections to organized crime. He also had a relationship with a number of Dallas policemen, which amounted to various favors in exchange for leniency in their monitoring of his establishments. He features prominently in Kennedy-assassination theories, and many believe he killed Oswald to keep him from revealing a larger conspiracy. In his trial, Ruby denied the allegation and pleaded innocent on the grounds that his great grief over Kennedy\u2019s murder had caused him to suffer \u201cpsychomotor epilepsy\u201d and shoot Oswald unconsciously. The jury found him guilty of the \u201cmurder with malice\u201d of Oswald and sentenced him to die. [PAR] In October 1966, the Texas Court of Appeals reversed the decision on the grounds of improper admission of testimony and the fact that Ruby could not have received a fair trial in Dallas at the time. In January 1967, while awaiting a new trial, to be held in Wichita Falls, Ruby died of lung cancer in a Dallas hospital. [PAR] The official Warren Commission report of 1964 concluded that neither Oswald nor Ruby were part of a larger conspiracy, either domestic or international, to assassinate President Kennedy. Despite its seemingly firm conclusions, the report failed to silence conspiracy theories surrounding the event, and in 1978 the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded in a preliminary report that Kennedy was \u201cprobably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy\u201d that may have involved multiple shooters and organized crime. The committee\u2019s findings, as with those of the Warren Commission, continue to be widely disputed.

There are many similarities in salivation between a cow and a pig. This is when secretion and mixing of saliva with food occurs. The parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual glands produce saliva. Both cows and pigs use saliva for moistening and lubricating food to help with chewing and swallowing. Another similarity is that it stimulates taste nerves. Also the washing action of saliva cleanses the mouth and prevents decay of leftover food particles. But the amount of saliva produced varies with species, diet, and health. In cows and other ruminants, saliva production is abundant and relatively continuous, although greater quantities are produced when eating and ruminating than while resting. Saliva produces N, P, and Na, which are utilized by rumen microorganisms and not by nonruminant species. Another difference between cows and pigs is that the ruminant relies on saliva for its buffering action. Saliva contains bicarbonates that buffer rumen acids, especially the volatile fatty acids. Another contrast is that the pig is the only farm mammal in which any amount of the enzyme ptyalin (amylase) is secreted by saliva. It is weak and only starts to break down the starch in food. Swallowing or deglutition: Swallowing is the reflex of passing food, water, or anything else from the mouth to the stomach via esophagus. This process is similar in both cows and [PAR] This preview has intentionally blurred sections. Sign up to view the full version.

The swallowing reflex is under neural control and is triggered by the presence of a material in the back of the mouth. Food is moved to the stomach by muscle contractions. The cardiac valve is at the end of the esophagus and it prevents food from coming back into the esophagus. The difference is that cows regurgitate so food is not being prevented from coming back into the esophagus. The Stomach\u2019s Role in Digestion: After passing through the esophagus, the feed travels to the animal\u2019s stomach. The stomach is used for mechanical and chemical digestion of feed but it also functions in storing food. The stomach is the major difference between a cow (ruminant) and a pig (nonruminant). A cow\u2019s stomach is composed of the following four compartments: rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. In contrast, a pig has a simple monogastric stomach. The main function of the cow\u2019s complex stomach is to allow the animal to use roughages (cellulose) as a source of energy. Microorganisms that are present in the first three stomachs ferment material and provide nutrients otherwise unavailable to the animal. The first of the cow\u2019s four stomach compartments is the rumen. The rumen is the site of anaerobic bacterial fermentation. The bacteria in the rumen digest carbohydrates and other plant materials in the mixed feed and produce volatile fatty acids as an excretory byproduct. These volatile fatty acids are absorbed through the rumen wall and give about 50 percent of the energy required for the ruminant. The next compartment is the reticulum. It also functions as a site of microbial action. The reticulum is a pacemaker of rumen contractions, mixing and moving contents through the [PAR] This is the end of the preview.

BSES entomologists identified 26 species of true wireworm in established cane fields in north, central and southern Queensland and in New South Wales. [PAR] Scientific name [PAR] True wireworms of recorded agronomic importance in Australia include potato wireworm (Hapatesus hirtus) and sugarcane wireworm (Agrypnus variabilis). False wireworms are major soil insect pests of establishing summer and winter crops in Queensland and New South Wales. False wireworms of agronomic importance in Australia include northern false wireworm (Gonocephalum carpentariae),           southern false wireworm (Gonocephalum macleayi), small false wireworm (Gonocephalum misellum), eastern false wireworm (Pterohelaeus darlingensis) and striate false wireworm (Pterohelaeus alternatus). [PAR] Life history [PAR] The lifecycle of true wireworms varies greatly between species. For example, sugarcane wireworm takes one year with four larval instars to complete its cycle whilst the potato wireworm takes approximately four years with 10 larval instars. [PAR] Summary of the lifecycle of the sugarcane wireworm (a true wireworm): Beetles emerge in October-November and migrate if habitat is not suitable. Female beetles require food (green leaf material) before they begin egg laying. Females lay eggs in November-February in batches of approximately 10 to 15 eggs. Eggs are laid on soil surface or           in small crevices. [PAR] Once larvae have emerged they generally remain in the top 50 mm of the soil profile during the first instar stage. Later larval instars will move deeper in the soil profile in response to moisture and temperature. Sugarcane wireworm take ten months and four instars for larvae to fully develop in SE           Queensland. Once larvae mature (in September-October) they hollow out small soil cells to pupate within. This stage generally takes about two weeks. [PAR] The lifecycles of the major false wireworm pest species are all similar: In central Queensland beetles emerge in October-January and migrate if the habitat is not suitable. Female beetles require food (green leaf material) before they begin egg laying. One month after emergence the females begin laying eggs on           the soil surface or just below.

At the start of each episode, we saw a tall, hexagonal box sitting on a table.

And from the box would emerge one of the residents of Camberwick Green. Following a brief chat between the narrator (Brian Cant) and the character (who would respond to Cant's questions silently with nods, shrugs and shakes of the head), the scene mixed through into Camberwick Green itself - a quiet country village with all the basic amenities (bakery, butcher, garage) and, in the land surrounding it, Windy Miller's windmill, Jonathan Bell's farm and the army fort commanded by Captain Snort.\u00a0 Show Less[DOC] [TLE] Camberwick Green - Childrens TV | Jedi's ParadiseCamberwick Green - Childrens TV | Jedi's Paradise [PAR] Camberwick Green Camberwick Green is a 60\u2019s children\u2019s TV animated show narrated by Brian Cant.

[PAR] Ray Galton and Alan Simpson wrote the first two series \u00a0 The idea proved a success leading to a long running series of one-off unrelated sitcoms that aired for 120 episodes from 1961 to 1975.

[PAR] Summary [PAR] The first two series of\u00a0Comedy Playhouse\u00a0were written by Ray Galton\u00a0and Alan Simpson, who had previously written very successfully for Tony Hancock, but after that the episodes were written by various writers. In total there were 27 sitcoms that started out from a pilot in the\u00a0Comedy Playhouse. The first eight series were broadcast in Black and White, the rest in colour. Like many television programs from the time, many of 1960s episodes are missing from the BBC archive presumed wiped. [PAR] Clips[DOC] [TLE] Galton and SimpsonRay Galton OBE (born 17 July 1930), and Alan Simpson OBE (born 27 November 1929), are British scriptwriters. They met in 1948 whilst recuperating from tuberculosis at the Milford sanatorium, near Godalming in Surrey. They based the sitcom Get Well Soon on their shared experiences at the facility. They are best known for their work with comedian Tony Hancock on radio and television between 1954 and 1961, and their long-running television situation comedy, Steptoe and Son, eight series of which were aired between 1962 and 1974.  [PAR] Career [PAR] The partnership's break in comedy writing came with the Derek Roy vehicle Happy Go Lucky, although this was not a success.  The Hancock connection began with their involvement with later radio variety series, and from November 1954 continued with Hancock's Half Hour on radio; a series featuring their scripts for Hancock ran on television between 1956 and 1961. In October that year Hancock ended his professional relationship with the writers, and with Beryl Vertue who worked with the writers' at their agency Associated London Scripts. This writers' co-operative had been founded by Eric Sykes and Spike Milligan, with others involved, including Hancock for a time.  [PAR] After their association with Hancock had ended, they wrote a series of Comedy Playhouse (1961\u201362), ten one-off half-hour plays for the BBC. One play in the series, The Offer, was well received, and from this emerged Steptoe and Son (1962\u201374), about two rag and bone men, father and son, who live together in a squalid house in West London. This was the basis for the American series Sanford and Son and the Swedish series Albert & Herbert. [PAR] Their comedy is characterised by a bleak and somewhat fatalistic tone. Steptoe and Son in particular is, at times, extremely black comedy, and close in tone to social realist drama. Both the character played by Tony Hancock in Hancock's Half Hour and Harold Steptoe (Harry H. Corbett) are pretentious, would-be intellectuals who find themselves trapped by the squalor of their lives. This theme had been expanded upon in their script for Tony Hancock's film The Rebel (1961), about a civil servant who moves to Paris to become an artist.

Based on the best-selling novel by Paul Theroux, this film tells the story of one man's attempt to create a utopian existence in the rain forest for his family, which ultimately evolves into a desperate fight for their survival. Co-starring Helen Mirren, River Phoenix, Butterfly McQueen and Jason Alexander. [PAR] Drama[DOC] [TLE] Amazon.com: The Mosquito Coast (Zaentz): Harrison Ford ...Amazon.com: The Mosquito Coast (Zaentz): Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren, River Phoenix, Conrad Roberts [PAR] By Steven Reynolds on December 4, 2002 [PAR] Format: DVD [PAR] Peter Weir's under-appreciated masterpiece draws a striking comparison between religious zealotry and the utopian fantasies of technological imperialism.  The smarmy Reverend Spellgood heads south into Central America to spread the Christian faith.  Paranoid inventor Allie Fox does likewise, but his mission is somewhat different though no less religious in its intensity - he wants to bring ice, and by his logic 'civilization', to the locals.  Both men are 'missionaries', both equally blind to the personal and social costs of the 'salvation' they bring.  The cast is excellent.  Helen Mirren is near flawless as the devoted but cautious mother, and River Phoenix really impresses as the coming-of-age son through whose eyes the story unfolds.  But Ford is absolutely perfect as the father.  This was truly inspired casting, as it uses our latent feelings for the actor to put us in precisely the same position as his on-screen family: we want to love him - this quintessentially paternal hero - despite his destructive obsession.  But in the end we have to accept that he gets exactly what he deserves.  I'm surprised Ford doesn't seek out more roles like this one, rather than settling for repetitive action fare or trying to reinvent himself as Bogart.  Adapted with considerable skill by Paul Schrader from an exquisite novel by Paul Theroux, this film is a rare find: a powerful, gripping, moving story with something important to say. [PAR] By J. Michael Click on June 18, 2000 [PAR] Format: DVD [PAR] Harrison Ford gives one of his most forceful and compelling performances as Allie Fox, an inventor who moves his family to the jungle of Central America to establish an isolationist utopia.  As his dream builds, and then  unravels, he moves along the scale from manic genius to meglomanic  obsession, putting him at heightened odds with  God, nature, man, and  finally, his own family. Ford's dazzling performance is enhanced by Helen  Mirren's quiet intensity as his loyal wife, and River Phoenix's thoughtful  portrayal of his observant oldest son.  Look quickly for cameos by Jason  Alexander (TV's \"Seinfeld\") and Butterfly McQueen (\"Gone  With the Wind\")!  A beautifully photographed and handsomely mounted  production, perceptively directed by Peter Weir. [PAR] The DVD offers both  widescreen and pan & scan tranfers; I preferred the widescreen which  preserves the film's magnificent visual compositions.  Video and sound are  both clear and crisp, and the theatrical trailer makes a nice bonus  supplement.  Recommended for fans of Ford and Weir, and for viewers who  like a strong mix  of character study and action-adventure. [PAR] Comment 42 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?

In 60 Tests he earned 249 wickets, and in 102 one-day internationals, he took 142 wickets. In 1981 Holding bowled what many cricket historians regard as the greatest over in Test history to English batsman Geoff Boycott. [PAR] Holding, a super fast bowler, had one of the smoothest bowling actions ever; in fact, he earned the nickname \u201cWhispering Death\u201d because of his silent approach to the bowling crease and the venom he then released. He could trouble even the best batsmen with his steep bounce and intimidating pace. A one-time 400-metre sprinter, Holding gathered pace from his long run-up and delivered with a classical, if slightly chest-on, motion. Holding made his Test (international two-innings, five-day match) debut against Australia in the 1975 series. His partnership with Andy Roberts became the foundation upon which the West Indies\u2019 four-pronged pace attack (four alternating fast bowlers) was built. In a Test against visiting India in 1976, he knocked the \u201ctourists\u201d out of the series with a fiery spell as five Indian batsmen were forced to quit the game as a result of injury. He was also a hard-hitting tailender batsman who had six 50-run stands in Tests. He was selected Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1977. Holding was forced to retire from International cricket because of hamstring and back injuries in 1987, having played for only 12 years. He went on to work as a popular TV commentator and was a member of the inaugural induction class of the International Cricket Council Hall of Fame in 2009.

The marine world is my teacher, my workplace and my love, yet Ron and I have but dabbled in what it offers \u2013 unknown depths, and their mysterious creatures, covering 72 per cent of our planet\u2019s surface. [PAR] Ron and I learnt very early that footage of sharks would sell more readily than that of any other marine animal. In the 1950s Movietone News (an international cinema-shown newsreel covering the years 1929\u201379) bought Ron\u2019s 16 mm footage, blew it up to 35 mm and showed it in theatres around the world. Then came television (in 1956 in Australia) and the public\u2019s lust for any images of sharks had us searching offshore waters for these \u201cdangerous\u201d predators. For us, filming sharks in their natural environment became a way of life. [PAR] There\u2019s no one way to describe sharks. There are hundreds of species, all with different characteristics, but few of them are potentially dangerous to humans. [PAR] The most threatening species cruising our coastline is the great white shark. The largest recorded great white was caught in 1978 off the Azores, a Portuguese archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean, roughly 1500 km from Lisbon. It was measured by an observer at 8.8 m and was estimated to weigh more than 4.5 tonnes. Claims of much larger great whites being caught are unsubstantiated. In fact, I\u2019m not even sure I believe the size of the Azores specimen, but the ocean is full of surprises and a super-sized shark could well be one of them. [PAR] Other potentially dangerous sharks along our coast are mostly of the genus Carcharhinus: bull sharks, bronze whalers, Galapagos and, in the tropics, the grey reef, silvertip and the tiger. Several other species of shark can become excited when there\u2019s food in the water, and spearfishermen have even been bitten by metre-long whitetips when handling a struggling, bleeding fish. I\u2019ve been bitten several times and always when there was food in the water. I never blamed the shark, only myself for being careless. [PAR] In the 1950s and early 1960s we believed what the media said \u2013 that the only good shark is a dead one and when you see a shark, it\u2019s either you or it. Our 50 years of experience has allowed us to separate the fact from this fiction. [PAR] 1. TRUE: Sharks can be stared down [PAR] While filming Blue Water, White Death in 1969, 200 km off the South African coast, we left the safety of our cages, which we tied to a dead whale, and fought off hundreds of large sharks, eventually making a place for ourselves in the midst of the pack.

When they bumped us, we bumped them back harder. Not one of us backed off. I waited to be bitten, torn apart, or to see my companions torn apart, and wondered what I would do when it happened. There was no fear, just a feeling of excitement and aggression. [PAR] It was like rewinding time.

In singles matches each player operates two sets of coloured counters (winks) rather than one. There are 6 winks (4 small and 2 large) of each colour (blue, green, red and yellow). The game is played on a six foot by three felt mat with a pot placed in the centre. The winks are played by using a 'squidger'; this is any circular disc between 25 and 51 mm in diameter. Players use different squidgers for different shots (like selecting a club in golf). A player normally only plays a single shot in each turn, but is rewarded with an extra shot if they happen to pot a wink of their own colour. Play is time limited. Pairs matches last for 25 minutes and Singles matches last for 20 minutes, after which each colour has a further five rounds, ending with the colour that started.

We are in the middle of the Second American Civil War.

[PAR] Advertisement [PAR] Times are hard. So hard, Americans insist on payment in Canadian dollars. Barb steers clear of politics. She's friends with the local police chief, who is on the take, but has a good heart. Then she gets involved in contraband. Some identity lenses are missing. Whoever possesses them can get free passage into Canada. A little guy says he knows where they are. A fat guy offers to buy them. The Congressional Directorate troops, dressed like Nazis, come into Barb's club and tear it apart, looking for them. You must remember this. It's \u201c Casablanca \u201d recycled. The biggest howler in the credits is the line \u201cbased on a story by Ilene Chaiken .\u201d Would it have killed Ilene to acknowledge \u201cCasablanca?\u201d True, there are differences, too; in this movie a kiss is not necessarily just a kiss--not when Barb's sex life includes nailing guys through the middle of the forehead with a stiletto heel. [PAR] Barb, inspired by a comic book heroine, is played by Pamela Anderson Lee, the \u201cBaywatch\u201d star, in leather, chains and an industrial-strength WonderBra. As the movie opens, she's on a trapeze, being sprayed by a hose in slow motion, a scene that reminded me of the climax of \u201c Behind the Green Door .\u201d That's when she's posing as a stripper. Later, when she poses as a hooker, it's to gain entry to an apartment so she can blow out the wall and rescue a hostage. Bogie was a wimp compared to Barb, whose personal DNA, if I heard correctly, \u201cholds the antidote to our secret weapon.\u201d The movie is wonderfully confusing, but I think that means she could have saved Topeka, whether by preventative intercourse or otherwise I haven't a clue. Pamela Anderson Lee, while not a great actress, is a good sport. [PAR] She's backlit in endless scenes where, if she could have figured out a way to send her breasts in separately, she could have stayed at home. \u201cDon't call me a babe,\u201d she says--a trademark line like \u201cMake my day\u201d or \u201cI'll be back.\u201d Everyone who calls her \u201cbabe\u201d pays with his life. (One guy tries to light her cigarette, which turns out to be a blow gun, and gets a poison dart between his eyes.) The parallels with \u201cCasablanca\u201d are fun to spot. The Sydney Greenstreet character, named Big Fatso (Andre Rosey Brown), reclines in the shovel of a Caterpillar tractor at his junkyard, munching on a turkey leg (or maybe an ostrich leg, it's so big) and offering to buy the contact lenses. But Barb has mercy on an idealistic young woman ( Victoria Rowell ) who is married to a resistance leader, and gives her the lenses. At the end, the heroes board an Air Canada flight.

In 1776, Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations, probably the most influential book on market economics ever written. [PAR] Born in 1723, Adam Smith was the son of a customs official in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. At 14, he entered the University of Glasgow. After graduating, he attended Oxford in England and studied philosophy. [PAR] Smith became a professor of philosophy at Glasgow in 1751. He actively took part in Glasgow debating societies and often argued for free trade. [PAR] In 1759, Smith published The Theory of Moral Sentiments. His book looked at human nature and ethics. At the beginning of the book, he stated that all people had the capacity to care about others. He pointed out that no matter how selfish a man might be, [PAR] . . . there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it. [PAR] But Smith also believed that people often acted in their self-interest, especially in economic matters. He contended, however, that this was not bad. He concluded that self-seeking individuals were \"led by an invisible hand\" that caused them to unintentionally act in ways that still benefited society. [PAR] In 1763, Smith quit his professorship at Glasgow and tutored the stepson of Charles Townshend, who later became Britain\u2019s treasury minister in the years leading up to the American Revolution. Smith traveled to Paris with his student and met Voltaire and other philosophers involved in the French Enlightenment. [PAR] Smith also met the leading French economist, Francois Quesnay. Quesnay had devised a system called \"Physiocracy,\" which he believed explained the source of national wealth. Quesnay took issue with the popular belief, known as mercantilism, that a nation\u2019s wealth was its hoard of gold or silver. He believed a nation\u2019s wealth came from its farm produce, which circulated throughout the land, nourishing everyone. Quesnay\u2019s innovative idea prompted Smith to begin to write his own book on economics. [PAR] In 1766, Smith moved to London. He worked as a researcher for Charles Townshend, who was then in charge of Britain\u2019s finances. Townshend had to deal with the huge national debt that resulted from the Seven Years\u2019 War. This war enabled Britain to seize all of French North America. Townshend wanted the American colonists to help pay down the war debt through such measures as a tax on tea. [PAR] Smith researched Britain\u2019s credit and debt along with the history of colonization by ancient Rome. He also became acquainted with leading political figures such as Benjamin Franklin and Edmund Burke (an important British political writer and leader). [PAR] The following year, Smith returned home to Scotland to finish his book, a task that took him nine more years. During this period, he visited London several times and witnessed debates in Parliament on the growing American resistance to British rule. [PAR] Finally, in March 1776, Smith published An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. This massive work of almost 1,000 pages was based on his exhaustive research and personal observations. Smith attacked government intervention in the economy and provided a blueprint for free markets and free trade. These two principles eventually would become the hallmarks of modern capitalism.

[PAR] 8.0 [PAR] By chillial ,        Jul 22, 2007 [PAR] In these days of mass media childrens television merchandising, it's nice to see that at least some series from our childhood haven't been given the same treatment. Mr Benn is a prime example. Walk into a card shop a a year or so ago, and chances are you'd have seen enough Bagpuss merchandise to sink a battleship; cuddly toys of different sizes, cards, beanies, annuals, magnets, you name it. It's nice to see Bagpuss get all that exposure but it seemed like our dear old friend had been seized by firms eager to squeeze as much cash out of him as possible. Not so Mr Benn! Mr Benn first appeared in book form in 1967 in the Red Knight. The character was created by David McKee. In 1971 the BBC made an animated series, directed and written by McKee, and a legend was born. It was constantly repeated during the 70s and 80s. McKee was also responsible for the likes of King Rollo (1980). At the start of each episode, Mr Benn leaves his house, Number 52 Festive Road (based on McKee's old house on Festing Road in Putney) and visits the costume shop. Then... \"As if by magic, the shopkeeper appeared,\" a funny looking little man wearing a fez. He suggests a costume for Mr Benn to try, who goes to the changing room. Mr Benn admires himself in his new costume in the mirror and when he steps out of a back door he finds himself in another world. If he wears a spacesuit he finds himself in a spaceship. If he's dressed as a cowboy he arrives in the Wild West. Mr Benn is faced with some problem in this new world that he usually has to help fix (for example, winning a balloon race). He always succeeds, and gets a souvenir of his trip to take back. The shopkeeper then appears and takes him back to the shop. The souvenirs provide some significan ce for Mr Benn at the end of the episode. All this made for an entertaining programme but what really raises it above the norm are the stories. McKee never wrote the standard cliches, oh no. For example, in the Red Knight, Mr Benn meets a dragon. Does he have to fight it? Nope. The dragon is the official 'fire lighter' for the King but has fallen out of favour with him because of a devious matchmaker trying to improve his business... brilliant! Then there's The Zoo-Keeper episode. Mr Benn tries to cheer up a zoo full of sad, cramped animals by releasing them from their cages. But they run amuck through the town and the only safe place the townspeople can find is... the animals' cages! Some subtle meaning here? :) Mr Benn was another extremely short series: only 13 episodes! (at 15 minutes each). Which is odd because I'm sure it went on for much longer than that when I was younger. It must have been on a continuous loop. A shame as it really deserved a lot more. The animation is nothing spectacular - a series of quickly moving pictures, but you can't really imagine Mr Benn any other way - it's perfect. The series was briliantly narrated by Ray Brooks, who also voiced all the characters. He is known for his acting appearances in acclaimed 1960s tv drama Cathy Come Home, and series Big Deal, Running Wild and Growing Pains. Brooks narrated King Rollo too. I have to mention the music too by Don Warren, especially his immediately recognisable theme tune. There's bound to be a mobile ringtone for it... There were eight Mr Benn books in total.

The cereal is actually made using a process that resembles shooting rice from a gun.  In 1904, Quaker introduced the cereal to the mass public by shooting Puffed Rice from cannons at the World's Fair.  In 1913, an astute ad man decided to promote the cereal by exploiting how it's made and this famous, yet mostly forgotten, slogan was invented.

[PAR] More about Nut & Honey Crunch [PAR] #17. \"It takes (x) bowls of your cereal to match the nutrition in one bowl of Total.\" [PAR] This bold ad campaign would pit Total cereal against best-selling cereals in a battle of nutrition.

In fact, the cereal was created as a response to a study that showed children, on average, didn't care for soggy cereals.

[PAR] Jimmy Hoffa and at least one of his Teamster lieutenants, Edward Partin, apparently did, in fact, discuss the planning of an assassination conspiracy against President Kennedy's brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, in July or August of 1962. Teamsters official, Frank Chavez spoke to Hoffa about murdering Robert Kennedy in early 1967, shortly before Hoffa went to Federal prison. During that incident, Hoffa reportedly sharply rebuked his aide, telling him that such a course of action was dangerous and should not be considered. [PAR] As the long-time La Cosa Nostra leader in an area that is based in New Orleans but extends throughout Louisiana and Texas, Carlos Marcello was one of the prime targets of Justice Department efforts during the Kennedy administration. He had, in fact, been temporarily removed from the country for a time in 1961 through deportation proceedings personally expedited by Attorney General Kennedy.  Marcello exhibited an intense dislike for Robert Kennedy because of these actions, claiming that he had been illegally \"kidnaped\"by Government agents during the deportation. Marcello had to worry about the prospect of Bobby Kennedy being elected president in 1968. As president, Bobby would have the resources to finally conduct a thorough, secret investigation of JFK's death. Bobby Kennedy's friend and biographer Jack Newfield wrote that a very close relative of Carlos Marcello told a government informant \"we took care of 'em (the Kennedys), didn't we?\" [PAR] After winning the strategic California primary, Robert F. Kennedy was gunned down in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Robert Kennedy died 25 hours later. The gunman was Sirhan Sirhan, a Jordanian immigrant who claimed no memory of the events. It was in a crowded kitchen corridor through which Kennedy was leaving the Ambassador Hotel after addressing supporters. As he passed slowly through a packed corridor, Sirhan fired into the crowd around the Senator. Three or four of the shots struck Kennedy, apparently from in front. One struck his clothing, one or two entered his right chest superficially and another hit his head. The first doctor on the scene, Stanley Abo, found a wound behind Kennedy's right ear with a powder burn indicating a very close range shot from behind. [PAR] Eyewitness accounts led to a guilty verdict and the death sentence, but in 1972, California abolished the death penalty. Sirhan's fate reverted to life in prison. Studies of Sirhan Sirhan show that his assassination of Robert Kennedy carried with it a goal of death to himself. Sirhan went so far as to plead for the gas chamber and to refuse appeals after receiving the death sentence. [PAR] Sirhan Sirhan had few employable skills and was living at alevel far below his expectations. Sirhan was failing at work, at school, and in social life. He began to think that if he shot a national figure whom he believed to be an enemy of the Palestinians - President Lyndon Johnson, Ambassador Arthur Goldberg , or Presidential Candidate (and Senator) Robert F. Kennedy - he could achieve the status he wished for and perhaps even change the situation of the Palestinian people. [PAR] Sirhan Sirhan was strongly anti-Zionist. His diaries, though confused, repeatedly suggest that his reason for attacking Kennedy was the latter's support for Israel in the 1967 Six-day War.  An entry in the diary found at Sirhan's home read, \"My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more and more of an unshakable obsession. RFK must die. RFK must be killed. Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated...Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated before 5 June 68.\" The date of the assassination was the first anniversary of the first day of the Six Day War. [PAR] Students of assassination in the U.S. have generally seen assassins and attackers of political leaders either as possessing \"political\" motives or as being \"deranged.\" This is a narrow andinaccurate view of assassination.

(And How to Fix Yours) [PAR] By Brent Kelley [PAR] Updated January 13, 2017. [PAR] A \"slice\" is a type of golf shot in which the golf ball curves dramatically in flight from left to right (for a right-handed golfer). The slice can be played intentionally, but is usually the result of a mishit. Slices are the most common problem for recreational and high-handicap golfers. The shape of a sliced shot differs for right-handed golfers and left-handed golfers (although the causes - more on that below - are identical): [PAR] For a right-hander, a slice curves to the right; [PAR] For a left-hander, a slice curves to the left. [PAR] (We'll stick with right-handedness in all examples to follow, so lefties need to reverse any directional elements.) [PAR] A slice and a fade shot \u00a0share the same shaping (curving to the right for a right-hander), except that a slice is more severe. A slang term for a slice is \" banana ball .\" [PAR] The slice is the opposite of a hook shot . [PAR] A sliced shot may start out left of the target line and then bend dramatically back to the right of the target. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Correcting a Slice [PAR] Or the ball can begin on the correct target line before swerving right. A shot that begins right of the target line and then curves farther right is a \"push-slice.\" [PAR] What Causes a Slice? [PAR] At its root, a sliced shot is caused by the clubface arriving at impact with the golf ball in an open position . This may be due to setup or swing issues that cause the face to open, or to an outside-to-inside swing path that effectively opens the face by \"wiping\" or \"swiping\" across the golf ball, imparting \"slice spin.\" (Slice spin is a clockwise sidespin for right-handed golfers, counter-clockwise for lefties.) Cutting across the ball at impact on an outside-to-inside swing path is also called \"coming over the top.\" [PAR] Those are the two primary causes of a slice, and in combination can create a much more severe slice. [PAR] Faults and fixes: More possible causes of a slice [PAR] How to Stop Slicing Your Shots [PAR] Is your golf game plagued by the dreaded slice? Start by checking out several of your fundamentals to make sure simple setup problems aren't causing that slice. [PAR] Make sure you are not gripping the club with the face in an open position. Unless you are trying to hit a ball that curves right (slice or fade) or left (hook or draw), set up with your clubface square. Or are you rotating the club open on the backswing? Make some backswings but stop when the club reaches parallel to the ground. The toe of your club should be pointing straight up. If it is \"laid off\" - pointing behind you - you already have an open clubface. [PAR] Make sure you are not setting up with an open stance (feet, hips, shoulders aligned left of the target line). Just like your clubface, you stance should be square. [PAR] Make sure your grip is in a neutral position and are you are not using a weak grip (hands turned too much to the left for a right-hander). Watch the video \" Strong and Weak Grips \" for details. [PAR] Often both the clubface position and the swing path must be corrected to permanently rid yourself of the unintentional slice. Watch: [PAR] Diagnosing and fixing a slice [PAR] There are many videos on YouTube from golf instructors that focus on the slice . And remember that the draw shot is the opposite of the slice, so teaching yourself how to draw the ball is also a way of eliminating the slice: [PAR] Video: How to hit a draw [PAR] It's always best to solve a problem in golf by fixing the root cause, such as a cluface position, swing path or setup issue\n\n\n### Answer:\nhook </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Once I came out of the usual trauma, I had a guitar with me and I wrote 'Angie' in an afternoon, sitting in bed, because I could finally move my fingers and put them in the right place again, and I didn't feel like I had to s--t the bed or climb the walls or feel manic anymore. I just went, 'Angie, Angie.' It was not about any particular person; it was a name, like ohhh, Diana. I didn't know Angela was going to be called Angela when I wrote 'Angie.'

It wasn't typical of their sound, since most of the band's material at the time was hard and aggressive. Still, it was a huge hit, and their only ballad that hit #1 in the US. [PAR] This is one of the few Rolling Stones songs that is acoustic. [PAR] Keith Richards wrote this song in Switzerland after the Exile on Main St. album had been approved by the record company, but before it was released. \"Angie\" was one of the first songs The Stones recorded for Goat's Head Soup, which they first attempted in Jamaica at the Dynamic Sounds studio in Kingston. They got very little done at these sessions, arriving nightly with armed escort and locking the doors until they were done for the day. Much of the album was done at sessions in Los Angeles and London under more hospitable conditions. [PAR] The Angela Bowie rumor picked up steam in 1990, when she went on The Joan Rivers Show and claimed she once walked in on David Bowie and Mick Jagger in bed together naked. What's even more shocking is that Rivers had her own talk show. She was quickly replaced by Arsenio Hall. [PAR] Nicky Hopkins played piano on this track. He became part of the band's inner circle after working on the 1966 Stones album Between The Buttons. >> [PAR] Suggestion credit: [PAR] Bertrand - Paris, France [PAR] In 2005 German chancellor Angela Merkel appropriated this acoustic ballad for her Christian Democratic Union Party. \"We're surprised that permission wasn't requested,\" said a Stones spokesman of Merkel's choice of song. \"If it had been, we would have said no.\" [PAR] The line from this song, \"Ain't it time we said goodbye,\" was used as the title to Robert Greenfield's 2014 book, which chronicles his time covering the Stones' 1971 British tour and their Exile on Main St. sessions for Rolling Stone magazine. Greenfield is not a fan of the song, however, calling it \"soppy and far too sweet for my taste.\"[DOC] [TLE] To All the Girls We\u2019ve Loved Before, Classic Songs About ...To All the Girls\n\n\n### Answer:\nbowie </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

It is situated on the A30 (London to Southampton and the South West of England) where this is crossed by the Guildford to Reading road. The M3 motorway forms Bagshot's southern boundary and the village is immediately adjacent to junction 3. [PAR] The neighbouring villages are: Windlesham, Sunningdale and Chobham to the east, Lightwater and Bisley to the south, and Frimley to the south west. Local towns are Camberley some 5 miles (8 km) to the south-west, Bracknell about 5 miles (8km) north-east, Windsor 10 miles (16 km) north, Woking 8 miles (13 km) south east and the Cathedral town of Guildford 12 miles (20 km) south. London Heathrow airport is about 15 miles (24 km) drive. [PAR] Geography [PAR] Bagshot is on the outer edge of the 'green belt' (an area surrounding London in which development is restricted in order to contain the urban spread), the natural vegetation of the area is heath land (from which the administrative borough of Surrey Heath derives its name). The village is separated from its neighbours by open land, most of it heath. Much of this surrounding land is owned by the Ministry of Defence, and some is Royal Estate. [PAR] The village is compact and the housing extends over less than 2 miles (3 km). [PAR] History [PAR] Bagshot is of Saxon origin, originally in a parish with Windlesham. Coaching inns were the major reason for Bagshot's original prosperity (the village is on the main road from London to the West Country), together with a Royal hunting lodge favoured by the Stuart kings (now known as Bagshot Park and which is again a Royal residence with its occupation by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex). [PAR] See here for more about the origins of Bagshot . [PAR] Growth of the village occurred during the first half of the 19th century, largely due to the coaching trade and agriculture, especially market gardening. The opening of the main line railway from London to Southampton and beyond in 1838 destroyed the coaching trade with a resultant depression, but the opening of the local railway line 20 years later promoted renewed growth, particularly with the nursery gardens being better able to supply London's Covent Garden market. [PAR] Bagshot separated from Windlesham to become its own ecclesiastical parish in 1874 and the Church was built 10 years later, largely with the patronage of the Duke of Connaught. [PAR] St Anne's Church has twice been honoured by a visit from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother , on the first occasion to commemorate the centenary of the building, and more recently to unveil a memorial plaque to Lady Patricia Ramsay ( Princess Patricia ). [PAR] Development, Housing & Infrastructure [PAR] There is a three-tier local government structure: Surrey County Council ; Surrey Heath Borough Council and Windlesham Parish Council (local government names in rural areas can cause some confusion as a Parish Council is the smallest unit of local government, it is unconnected with the church). [PAR] Significant growth has occurred in the size of the village since the 1950's, and especially since the late 60's. The general area having been earmarked in the national and county strategic plans for growth. Most of the housing has been built as diverse estates, though none is excessively large and the essential characteristics of a large village have not been destroyed. [PAR] There is an adequate range of shops centred on the High Street. Perhaps still harking back to Bagshot's coaching origins, there are a surprising number of public houses, restaurants and 'take away' cooked food vendors, a lot of their trade coming from outside the village. [PAR] Recreation facilities in Bagshot are afforded by two multi-use sports fields and a cricket field . Each have a pavilion / social club and one used to have a youth centre run by the county. There is a tennis club and several local golf clubs. An indoor centre with comprehensive facilities including swimming is available in Camberley, other facilities\n\n\n### Answer:\nearl of wessex </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] Insulin Injection Sites [PAR] In the Bloodstream [PAR] The Effects of Insulin on the Body [PAR] Insulin is a natural hormone produced in the pancreas. When you eat, your pancreas releases insulin to help your body make energy out of sugars (glucose). It also helps you store energy. Insulin is a vital part of metabolism. Without it, your body would cease to function. [PAR] In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas is no longer able to produce insulin. In Type 2 diabetes, the pancreas initially produces insulin, but the cells of your body are unable to make good use of the insulin (insulin resistance). [PAR] Uncontrolled diabetes allows glucose to build up in the blood rather than being distributed to cells or stored. This can wreak havoc with virtually every part of your body. Complications of diabetes include kidney disease, nerve damage, eye problems, and stomach problems. [PAR] People with Type 1 diabetes need insulin therapy to live. Some people with Type 2 diabetes must also take insulin therapy to control blood sugar levels and avoid complications. Insulin is usually injected into the abdomen, but it can also be injected into the upper arms, thighs, or buttocks. Injection sites should be rotated within the same general location. Frequent injections in the same spot can cause fatty deposits that make delivery of insulin more difficult.

Known for his weird and outlandish subject matter, Dali's most famous work of art is probably The Persistence of Memory (1931), often called just \"Clocks\" and widely regarded as a Surrealist masterpiece. But what is the meaning behind Salvador Dali's painting The Persistence of Memory? What do all of those melted clocks mean? [PAR] Salvador Dali & the Surrealists [PAR] The meaning behind Surrealist Salvador Dali's artistic masterpiece The Persistence of Memory (1931) is not easy to grasp. In the painting, four clocks are prominently on display in an otherwise empty desert scene. While this might seem uncanny enough, the clocks are not flat as you might expect them to be, but are bent out of shape, appearing to be in the act of melting away. In classic Surrealist manner, this weird and unexpected juxtaposition poses a lot of questions right upfront. First off, why are these clocks melting? Why are the clocks out in the desert? Where are all the people? [PAR] Since the subject matter and content of the Salvador Dali's clocks painting seems illogical or irrational, one might be surprised by the very representational and nearly photographic quality of the painting, fitting well with Dali's own description of his art as being \"hand-painted dream photographs.\" The concept of the \"dream\" is integral in understanding Surrealism and plays a key role in the meaning of The Persistence of Memory, as well. [PAR] Surrealist Art and the Importance of the Dream State [PAR] Coming up with the best visual representation of what it is like to be dreaming was one of the main goals of the Surrealists. In the beginning, Surrealism might seem a little crazy, but we've all had dreams where unrelated people, places, or objects come together in completely inexplicable ways. Understanding that Persistence of Memory most likely depicts a dream state is the first part of coming up with a meaning for this painting. [PAR] Salvador Dali Clocks Meaning in a Dream [PAR] If Persistence of Memory depicts a dream state, the melting and distorted clocks symbolize the erratic passage of time that we experience while dreaming. Have you ever woken up and expected it to be still the middle of the night and are surprised to find that it is already morning? While we often are pretty good and keeping track of what time it is while we go about our days, keeping time while we are asleep is another story. There are many different ways to interpret the meaning of Persistence of Memory. If we look at the art through the perspective of a dream state, the distorted clocks don't have any power in the dream world and are melting away because of that. [PAR] In Persistence of Memory Salvador Dali illustrates how useless, irrelevant, and arbitrary our normal concept of time is inside the dream state. During our daily lives, we're always rushed and busy, trying to get all of our work done on time. Many art scholars debate over whether these timepieces are clocks or in fact pocket watches, very popular accessories in the 1920s and 30s, when the Surrealists worked. The Surrealists laughed at most things middle-class society takes seriously, and that includes the importance we place on things like pocket watches that mark passage of time. [PAR] Salvador Dali Soft Clocks Meaning, Einstein & Relativity [PAR] Some art scholars believe that Dali's melting clocks may symbolize Albert Einstein's groundbreaking Theory of Relativity, a new and revolutionary idea back in the culture of the 1930s. Through the theory of relativity, Einstein proposed a new concept of time as being relative and complex--not something fixed and easily tracked with as crude a gadget as a pocket watch. In Persistence of Memory, Salvador Dali shows the clocks melting away and thus losing their power and stability over the world around them. Through his melting clocks, Salvador Dali might be saying that simple machines like wall clocks\n\n\n### Answer:\npersistence of memory </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

The tale is generally considered to be the first detective story. [PAR] The story describes the extraordinary \u201canalytical power\u201d used by Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin to solve a series of murders in Paris. Like the later Sherlock Holmes stories, the tale is narrated by the detective\u2019s roommate. [PAR] Following the publication of Poe\u2019s story, detective stories began to grow into novels and English novelist Wilkie Collins published a detective novel, The Moonstone, in 1868. In Collins\u2019 story, the methodical Sergeant Cuff searches for the criminal who stole a sacred Indian moonstone. The novel includes several features of the typical modern mystery, including red herrings, false alibis, and climactic scenes. [PAR] The greatest fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes, first appeared in 1887, in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s novel A Study in Scarlet. The cozy English mystery novel became popularized with Agatha Christie\u2019s Miss Marple series in the 1920s, when other detectives like Lord Peter Wimsey and Ellery Queen were also becoming popular. In the 1930s, sometimes called the golden age of detective stories, the noir detective novel became the mainstay of writers like Dashiell Hammet, Raymond Chandler, and Mickey Spillane. Tough female detectives such as Kinsey Millhone and V.I. Warshawski became popular in the 1980s. [PAR] Related Videos[DOC] [TLE] The Sign of the FourPlot [PAR] The Sign of the Four (1890), also called The Sign of Four, is the second novel featuring Sherlock Holmes written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Doyle wrote four novels and 56 stories starring the fictional detective. [PAR] The story is set in 1888.  The Sign of the Four has a complex plot involving service in East India Company, India, the Indian Rebellion of 1857, a stolen treasure, and a secret pact among four convicts (\"the Four\" of the title) and two corrupt prison guards. It presents the detective's drug habit and humanizes him in a way that had not been done in the preceding novel, A Study in Scarlet (1887). It also introduces Doctor Watson's future wife, Mary Morstan. [PAR] According to Mary, in December 1878, her father had telegraphed her upon his safe return from India and requested her to meet him at the Langham Hotel in London. When Mary arrived at the hotel, she was told her father had gone out the previous night and not returned. Despite all efforts, no trace has ever been found of him. Mary contacted her father's only friend who was in the same regiment and had since retired to England, one Major John Sholto, but he denied knowing her father had returned. The second puzzle is that she has received six pearls in the mail from an anonymous benefactor, one per year since 1882 after answering an anonymous newspaper query inquiring for her. With the last pearl she received a letter remarking that she has been a wronged woman and asking for a meeting. Holmes takes the case and soon discovers that Major Sholto had died in 1882 and that within a short span of time Mary began to receive the pearls, implying a connection. The only clue Mary can give Holmes is a map of a fortress found in her father's desk with the names of Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan and Dost Akbar. [PAR] Holmes, Watson, and Mary meet Thaddeus Sholto, the son of the late Major Sholto and the anonymous sender of the pearls. Thaddeus confirms the Major had seen Mary's father the night he died; they had arranged a meeting to divide a priceless treasure Sholto had brought home from India. While quarreling over the treasure, Captain Morstan\u2014long in weak health\u2014suffered a heart attack.

A. Milne , the name \"Hundred Acre Wood\" is used only to refer to the parts of the forest surrounding Owl 's house, with the other characters residing outside of it. Nowadays, however, and especially in the Disney adaptations of the franchise, the name is usually used to refer to the whole forest, as Milne's books provided no better alternative for it. Thus, using the broader definition, the Hundred Acre Wood includes such locations as Owl's House , Pooh's house , Piglet's house , the Pooh Corner (renamed Pooh & Piglet Corner in Piglet's Big Movie ), the Poohsticks Bridge , Rabbit's house and Tigger's house .     What follows is a list of locations mentioned in the book and shown in the Wood's map: [PAR] Pooh Bear's House [PAR] Locations featured only in Disney stories include Gopher's tunnels , the Scary Woods and the Heffalump Hollow . [PAR] Locality [PAR] As stated above, the exact locality of the Hundred Acre Wood is uncertain. It is generally believed to be in the United Kingdon, as it is based on a real British forest (see below). However, this possibility is problematic due to the fact that there are no bears living in the\u00a0British Isles\u00a0in real life (a fact that may also apply to Tigger , although within the Winnie-the-Pooh universe he is actually a member of the fictional \"Tigger\" species, not a tiger, as generally believed). In Disney adaptations of the stories, it is likely that the Wood is in North America, which could explain away not only Pooh but also Gopher , a character not present in the original books, and whose species is indigenous to North America. However, it is the presence of Kanga and Roo that becomes problematic with this assumption, as there is a population of wild kangaroos living on the UK (an invasive species), but not in the USA. This could be explained away by the fact that, both in the books and cartoons, it is believed that Kanga and Roo have moved from Australia. However,\u00a0this means that Gopher has probably\u00a0moved from America. In the episode \" The Piglet Who Would Be King \", from The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh , Piglet , Tigger and Rabbit travel to a place called the Land of Milk and Honey , located in a jungle, under a volcano. While it is unclear how far they traveled to get there, the presence of a jungle even moderately near the Hundred Acre Wood pretty much puts the last nail in the coffin of the idea that the Wood is in England as far as Disney adaptations go, even though there is no jungle in the USA. [PAR] Behind the scenes [PAR] The Hundred Acre Wood is based on an actual place called the Five Hundred Acre Wood, situated in the Ashdown Forest, in East Sussex, England, where A. A. Milne was living when he wrote the books. Today, areas of this wood have been named after locations seen or mentioned in Milne's Pooh books, as a tribute to the author, including a bridge identified as the Poohsticks Bridge, and an area designed as the Enchanted Place. There is also a memorial plaque dedicated to both Milne and Ernest H. Shepard , who illustrated the classic books.

The song was inspired by Wilson's days as a club DJ in Leeds, England, where the group was formed.

[PAR] Although Michelle Ryan may not be very well known in the United States, all of that is about to change as the actress best known in the UK as Zoe Slater on the hit BBC soap opera EastEnders has landed the lead role in the TV remake of The Bionic Woman. Hollywood Reporter reveals that 22 year old British actress Michelle Ryan has snagged the lead role in an NBC remake of the classic 70's sci-fi TV hit The Bionic Woman. As reports further reveal, Michelle Ryan, who is best known in her native Britain as Zoe Slater on the long running BBC soap EastEnders will play Jaime Sommers, a woman who nearly dies in a fatal accident only to be reconstructed with $50 million dollars worth of high-tech parts. According to Variety, Michelle Ryan beat out several big name Hollywood actresses to land the role of Bionic Woman Jaime Sommers, a role originally made famous by the lovely Lindsay Wagner. While producers of the new TV pilot have admitted the new version of The Bionic Woman will be a modern updated remake of the hit 1976 TV original, reports also reveal that the reason for selecting an unknown actress was due in part because producers felt that they wanted someone who will be a fresh face to American audiences, much in the same way that Lindsay Wagner was during the original run of The Bionic Woman. In 2000, Michelle Ryan got her first big break on the popular BBC1 program EastEnders at the age of fifteen in the role of Zoe Slater. After putting in five years on EastEnders, Michelle Ryan left the series to pursue work in film and theatre. Ryan has since appeared on the cover of FHM magazine, and in 2005 Michelle had a part in the play Who's the Daddy by Toby Young and Lloyd Evans at the famed King's Head Theatre in London. In 2006, Michelle Ryan also appeared in an episode of Marple and the independent film, Cashback, as well as Jekyll, a modern version of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde that starred James Nesbitt for the BBC. As well, Michelle Ryan was reported to have auditioned for the role to replace Billie Piper as the Doctor's companion in the new version of Doctor Who, but lost out to Freema Agyeman. Aside from The Bionic Woman, the Michelle Ryan will also be seen in the new adaptation of Mansfield Park opposite Billie Piper for ITV. An actress who's in hot demand these days, Ryan will also play Lila in the film I Want Candy alongside Carmen Electra and Mackenzie Crook, which is scheduled for a March 23, 2007 release. In the mid-1970's, The Bionic Woman became a hit with fans as a spin-off of The Six Million Dollar Man, starring Lee Majors. Running on ABC from 1976 to 1978, The Bionic Woman starred Lindsay Wagner as Jaime Sommers, a professional tennis player involved in a tragic skydiving accident. Barely surviving the fall, Jaime was rebuilt by Oscar Goldman, the same man that reconstructed The Bionic Man (Lee Majors). After the first season on ABC, The Bionic Woman jumped to NBC, where it enjoyed another season from 1977 to 1978. In total, the series produced 58 episodes. The Bionic Woman also appeared in various episodes of The Six Million Dollar Man as Steve Austin's girlfriend. The first signs of a new television series about The Bionic Woman began back in 2002 when producers Jennifer and Suzanne Todd announced that they would be resurrecting the show on the USA network. Reports also suggested that Jennifer Aniston was being considered for the lead role, but after the original announcement nothing else came of the show until NBC/Universal announced in October 2006 that it was bringing The Bionic Woman back to life.

In which country was he born?\n\n### Context:\n[DOC] [TLE] The Canadian-born British Prime Minister, Andrew Bonar Law ...The Canadian-born British Prime Minister, Andrew Bonar Law | Leaders and Legacies [PAR] Home \u00bb Columns \u00bb The Canadian-born British Prime Minister, Andrew Bonar Law [PAR] The Canadian-born British Prime Minister, Andrew Bonar Law [PAR] September 26, 2014 in Columns , Leaders from History Leave a comment [PAR] By Arthur Milnes [PAR] Since his tragic death in 1923, only months after he became Britain\u2019s prime minister, Andrew Bonar Law (who served only 209 days in the UK\u2019s top political job) has not done well in the historical sweepstakes.\u00a0 Despite his significance in British politics during the early part of the 20th century, especially considering his service as Tory leader in the run-up to the First World War and beyond, he has, sadly, remained, \u201cThe Unknown Prime Minister.\u201d [PAR] This sad descriptive is said to have been bequeathed him by Herbert Henry Asquith the very day Bonar Law was interred at Westminster Abbey. Asquith is reputed to have remarked it was very fitting the \u201cUnknown Prime Minister\u201d was buried near the Unknown Soldier in the Abbey. Few biographies have been written, and his name is rarely invoked by either historians or his heirs to leadership in the modern-day British Conservative party. [PAR] Since the Brits have done as much as possible to forget him, it high time we Canadians fill the void. Bonar Law, after all, was the only British prime minister to have been born in Canada \u2014 and the only one ever born outside the U.K. It also has to be noted that his closest friend in adult life was none other than his fellow Canadian Max Aitken, known in British society, and now, before history, as Lord Beaverbrook. [PAR] We should start the campaign to repatriate Bonar Law\u2019s historical reputation back to Canada, where at least we do our best to honour it already. The Presbyterian manse in Rexton, N.B., where the future statesman of Britain and Empire was born on Sept. 16, is already a historic site. (It was called Kingston at the time of Bonar Law\u2019s birth). It is proudly funded by the residents of the tiny village and a few years back the provincial government of New Brunswick provided a generous infusion of funds. (Bonar Law\u2019s father ministered to the congregation there for more than 30 years). [PAR] Open from June until mid-September each year, the Bonar Law Historic Site, restored to interpret life on a 19th century working farm in Canada, boasts free admission, offers guided tours in French or English, has a gift shop, and has a place where visitors can picnic.\u00a0 Thanks to concern for the historical memory of a British prime minister, visitors to the Canadian site will continue in the years ahead to learn about the early years of a British PM. The site is located on Andrew Bonar Law Avenue and features a cairn to honour Bonar Law, which was unveiled in 1925. Though the population of Rexton is only about 1,000 people, the village\u2019s website proudly trumpets the fact that a British prime minister was born there and villagers have taken the time to place a biography of Bonar Law on their homepage. It might not be Trafalgar Square or Chartwell, but it is something. [PAR] So, I have to ask my British friends the age-old question: What have you done for Bonar Law lately? [PAR] Canada\u2019s Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, has done his part. During his historic address to the British Parliament in 2013, Harper invoked Bonar Law. [PAR] \u201cSome will tell you that I am the second Canadian Prime Minister to address the British Parliament,\u201d he said, \u201c\u201cthe truth be told, I am the third. It is true that William Lyon Mackenzie King was the only other Prime Minister of Canada to address a gathering such as this. But Andrew Bonar Law often addressed this Parliament, during the 1920s, in his capacity as Prime Minister of Great Britain. And he was also Canadian, born in New Brunswick, just a few leagues removed\u00a0 from the place where my own ancestors settled after arriving from England in 1774\n\n\n### Answer:\ncanada </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] Portrait of Spencer Perceval in 1816 by George Francis Joseph [PAR] All that is generally remembered about Spencer Perceval is that he was the only British prime minister ever to be assassinated. By all accounts he was a thoroughly decent, honourable and competent man, but he was cut off in his prime and failed to make any lasting mark. A lawyer, born in London, the younger son of an aristocratic family and educated at Harrow and Cambridge, he became an MP in his thirties in 1796. He was a Tory and a strong supporter of Pitt the Younger and the war against Napoleon. After being solicitor general and attorney general he was appointed chancellor of the exchequer under the Duke of Portland in 1807 following Pitt\u2019s death and became premier himself in 1809. [PAR] In his book The Assassination of the Prime Minister David Hanrahan gives a vividly detailed account of that sunny Monday afternoon in May when at about a quarter past five the 49-year-old Spencer Perceval entered the lobby of the House of Commons on his way into the chamber. A man who had been sitting quietly by the fireplace stood up, walked towards the prime minister, took a pistol out of his overcoat and fired it at Perceval, hitting him in the chest. The prime minister staggered and fell, crying out \u2018I am murdered!\u2019 [PAR] There were naturally moments of complete astonishment as the man who had fired the shot walked back to the fireplace and sat down again. He made no attempt to get away as an MP called William Smith (future grandfather of Florence Nightingale) and several others carried the stricken Perceval to the Speaker\u2019s apartments, where they sat him on a table, holding him up. He said nothing more and uttered only a few sounds that Smith described as \u2018convulsive sobs\u2019.\n\n\n### Answer:\nspencer perceval </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

He is primarily portrayed by a glove puppet (see picture) but has also been depicted in animated cartoon shorts and comic strips. The character has featured on children's (and later adult) television from the 1960s to the present day. [PAR] A mischievous character, Basil Brush is known for his catch phrase \"Boom! Boom!\", used after something he finds funny, and also for speaking in a \"posh\" accent and manner, referring to himself as a \"fella\". The character claims to dislike puppets, and says his most prized possession is his \"brush\", this being the traditional name for a fox's tail. His persona, speech and gap-toothed look are said to have been based on the actor Terry-Thomas. [PAR] Basil Brush was originally created in 1963 by Peter Firmin for The Three Scampies children's show, but his main popularity was achieved due to appearances on \"The Nixon Line\" with magician David Nixon and subsequently The Basil Brush Show, which premiered in 1968. Basil was for many years operated and voiced by the publicity-shy actor Ivan Owen, who died in 2000. [PAR] Contents [PAR] TV [PAR] The Basil Brush Show [PAR] Throughout the 12-year run of the show, Basil was always accompanied by an actor, initially Rodney Bewes \u2014 aka Mr Rodney \u2014 better known as one half of The Likely Lads. Bewes was replaced by Mr Derek \u2014 Derek Fowlds, later to appear in Yes Minister and Heartbeat \u2014 who was the stooge for Basil's quips between 1969 and 1973. The subsequent presenters were Mr Roy (Roy North, 1973-1977), Mr John Howard (Howard Williams, 1977-1979), and Mr Billy (Billy Boyle, 1979-1980). [PAR] Basil was in three more shows in the 1980s: the educational programme Let's Read... With Basil Brush (ITV, 1982-1983), Crackerjack (BBC), and Basil's Joke Machine (ITV, 1986).[1] [PAR] Basil also came on The Weakest Link in 2006. [PAR] Basil recorded two albums (both with the same title), Boom! Boom! It's Basil Brush in 1970 and 1977. His adventures also appeared on the pages of TV Comic during the peak of his popularity. [PAR] The Basil Brush Show from 2002 [PAR] The Basil Brush Show (2002 TV series) In 2002, Basil made a comeback in a new children's BBC sitcom, again named The Basil Brush Show, in which his new comic foil, Stephen , is played by Christopher Pizzey . It is produced by The Foundation, part of the RDF Media Group. Child actors Georgina Leonidas and Michael Hayes also appear on the show. Basil Brush is now shown to have a family, which includes his destructive, hyperactive but cute nephew Bingo, and his criminal cousin Mortimer. Other friends have been introduced as well, such as the moneymaking child Master Dave and the more sensible Molly as well as Miss Hippy, as played by Rhiannon Duffin[1]. Where the original shows were taped before an audience of children, the new programme is shot in studio and features a hysterical, post-production laughter track. In keeping with Basil's history, no-one is directly credited as being Basil's puppeteer on this show, although actor Michael Windsor is credited as either Basil's \"fitness instructor\" or his \"personal assistant\". Michael Windsor was revealed to be the puppeteer. [PAR] Interspersed with the main programme, there are now various animated shorts in which Basil and/or another character is seen making jokes. The more recent puppet looks different from the original 1960s/ 1970s puppet in a number of aspects, but the 'well-spoken' voice of Basil is similar to the original Ivan Owen version.

Unemployment and inflation were  reaching record levels. Public morale was low. The new Conservative government  under Prime Minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher had recently unveiled a highly  unpopular budget. The country was still reeling from the effects of months of  industrial strikes that had brought down the Labour government and led to the \u2018Winter of Discontent\u2019. One such industrial dispute at London\u2019s Thames  Television came to an end on 24 October after blacking out the entire  Independent Television network for close to 11 weeks. [PAR] Against  this dismal background, Thames Television introduced its new action series for  the autumn season on Monday 29 October \u2014 a programme with the intriguing title Minder. The show was already weeks overdue, the new season\u2019s line-up traditionally  being unveiled in early to mid-September. [PAR] At that time, nobody could possibly  have imagined the eventual success that Minder would enjoy. Today,  probably due in large part to the series, the term \u2018minder\u2019 is widely  understood to mean a bodyguard or assistant. In 1979, this usage was much less  familiar, and the idea that it could form the basis of a television series  extending over 100 episodes would have seemed highly improbable. But by the  time the final series ended in 1994 the show could account for ten series, 105  52-minute episodes, aChristmas compilation of excerpts,  two feature films and two different actors playing the minder. The programme  became amajor hit not only on British television but was also sold to over 70  countries around the world, making it one of Britain\u2019s top TV exports. In 1985,  at the peak of its success, nearly 18 million people a week in Britain were  watching the show. [PAR] But in Autumn 1979, Minder was  unashamedly intended as a follow-up series for its leading actor, Dennis  Waterman, to capitalise on his popularity in an earlier Thames Television  series The Sweeney, that had recently come to an end. [PAR] Dennis Waterman [PAR] Dennis Waterman was no newcomer to  acting and came with excellent credentials. The last of nine children, he was  born in Clapham, London on 24 February 1948 and joined the Corona Stage School  in Chiswick when he was eleven. He made his screen debut in January 1960 just  before his 12th birthday in the feature film Night Train for Inverness about  a jail escapee who kidnaps his son (Waterman) and takes him on a train to  Scotland unaware that the child has diabetes and requires regular medication.  The following year he appeared in the West End musical show The Music Man. In  1962 he was cast in the title role of the children\u2019s BBC television series William based on the stories of Richmal Crompton. He went to Hollywood for a year  whenhe was fifteen to appear in the American sitcom Fair Exchange, which  was never shown in Britain. On his return to London he had a number of  television roles including the iconic Up the Junction in 1968 directed  by Peter Collinson about the social divide between the rich and poor. But his  big break came when he landed a part in Thames Television\u2019s police drama The  Sweeney. [PAR] The Sweeney, in which he co-starred with the late John Thaw, was a no-holds-barred  action series based in London about two officers in Scotland Yard\u2019s Flying  Squad (known as the \u2018Sweeney Todd\u2019 in rhyming slang). Dennis Waterman played  the part of Detective Sergeant George Carter while John Thaw played Carter\u2019s  guv\u2019nor, Detective Inspector Jack Regan. In its quest to achieve gritty  realism, the programme\u2019s action sequences, tough dialogue, car chases and  violence \u2014 on both sides of the law \u2014 set a new standard in British police  shows.

One of the more recognizable creatures of Japanese folklore, they  are mischievous but jolly creatures, masters at deceiving and tricking other people.  Tanukis are also especially well known for their powers of shape-shifting and disguise.

Often taking the form of birds of prey, their clawed feet resemble talons and their long noses are like beaks, which is considered their most defining characteristic. [PAR] In most folktales, tengus are portrayed as ridiculous creatures, easily confused and mislead by the humans that they encounter. For example, in the popular tale \"The Tengu's Magic Cloak\", a young boy manages to dupe a tengu into trading its magical straw cloak, capable of rendering the wearer invisible, for an ordinary piece of bamboo. [PAR] Another tale, \"The Tengu's Gourd\", tells of gambler who also manages to outwit a tengu. A tengu and the gambler meet one day and the tengu asks him what he is most afraid of. The gambler lies and says he is afraid of gold and mochi (rice cakes). The tengu replies by answering truthfully that he is frightened of a kind of plant. The tengu, thinking himself clever by intending to scare the gambler, then causes it to rain money and mochi. The gambler who in reality is not afraid of such things at all, is of course extremely happy.

She emerged at private cocktail soir\u00e9es and lounges, and the cocktail dress, as a short evening sheath with matching hat, shoes, and gloves was designated to accompany her. [PAR] Chanel cocktail dress [PAR] The cocktail affair generally took place between six and eight P.M., yet by manipulating one\u2019s accessories, the cocktail ensemble could be converted to appropriate dress for every event from three o\u2019clock until late in the evening. Cocktail garb, by virtue of its flexibility and functionality, became the 1920s uniform for the progressive fashionable elite. [PAR] Birth of the Cocktail Ensemble [PAR] By the end of World War I, the French couture depended rather heavily on American clientele and to an even greater extent on American department stores that copied and promoted the French cr\u00e9ateurs. As cocktailing had originated in the United States, the French paid less attention to the strict designations of line, cut, and length that American periodicals promoted for their heure de l\u2019aperitif. Instead, the couturi\u00e8res Chanel and Vionnet created garments for the late afternoon, or \u201cafter five,\u201d including beach pajamas\u2014silk top and palazzo pant outfits worn with a mid-calf-length wrap jacket. [PAR] Louise Boulanger produced les robes du studio, chic but rather informal sheaths that suited the hostess of private or intimate cocktail gatherings. [PAR] As the popularity of travel grew, both in American resort cities like Palm Beach, \u201cthe Millionaire\u2019s Playground,\u201d and abroad with the luxury of the Riviera, these French cocktail garments gained favor in wealthy American circles. But while America\u2019s elite were promoting the exclusive designs of the French couture, the majority of the United States relied on the advertisements of Vanity Fair and American Vogue, as well as their patronage of American department stores to dress for the cocktail hour. [PAR] Created by Chanel in 1926, the little black dress was translated to ready-to-wear as a staple of late afternoon and cocktail hours; American women at every level of consumption knew the importance of a practical \u201cWell-mannered Black\u201d. [PAR] Mid-1920s skirt lengths were just below the knee for all hours and affairs. Though cocktail attire featured the longer sleeves, modest necklines, and sparse ornamentation of daytime clothing, it became distinguished by executions in evening silk failles or satins, rather than wool crepes or gabardines. Often the only difference between a day dress and a cocktail outfit was a fabric noir and a stylish cocktail hat.

Some families also play games where they display items representing professions \u2013 pens to represent a journalist, books to signify a professor, lemon to represent a farmer \u2013 in front of the baby. It is said that the item that the baby chooses to pick represents its future profession. [PAR] In Jewish culture, for example, girls become bat mitzvah on the 12th birthday, while boys become bar mitzvah on their 13th birthday.

[PAR] There are several methods that one can use to get curds out of milk: temperature-mediated coagulation, acid-mediated coagulation, and enzyme-mediated coagulation.  In order to understand how these processes work, though, we have to talk about the structure and composition of the delicious, delicious globs of fat in milk that give rise to cheese. [PAR] The Globs [PAR] To a cheesemaker, the most important parts of the milk are the micelles.  What is a micelle, you say?  It\u2019s a clump of molecules that hang around together in a liquid, and they are usually in a spherical form. [PAR] Image from University of Calgary Department of Chemistry [PAR] They hang out in a sphere because these molecules, such as the fatty acids found in milk, contain both a polar and a non-polar portion.  Polar molecules, like water, do not like to mix with non-polar molecules, like oils or fats.  At the molecular level, polar and non-polar molecules will repel each other \u2013 which makes them thermodynamically unstable.  As a result, the molecules will begin to align such that there is minimal contact between the polar and non-polar molecules.  This is the precise reason why oil and water mixed together will eventually separate in to two layers.  Prior to forming a full-on layer, though, the oil will form micelles.  You can see the spherical oil micelles form if you shake up a bottle of oil and water. [PAR] The Milk [PAR] Milk is considered an emulsion of fat, protein, and lactose in water.  In all milk types, the fat is present in micelles that are composed of both saturated and unsaturated fats.  Cow milk has very large fat globules compared to other mammals.  Since these can be hard to digest, most dairies will homogenize the milk.  This results in much smaller, emulsified fat globules that don\u2019t float to the top of the container to form a cream layer.  In addition to the fat micelles, there are also casein micelles.  These are much smaller globs that contain calcium phosphate (CaP) inside.  In an animal, these micelles are meant to carry the CaP to the infant\u2019s stomach. [PAR] Our goal is to get the micelles interacting with each other so that they will coagulate and form a gel (the curds).  We can do this using one of the following methods. [PAR] Enzyme-Mediated Coagulation [PAR] This process involves the use of rennet, which is used to make most cheeses.  Rennet can be composed of one or more proteases, including pepsin, chymosin, and proteses derived from microbes such as Mucor miehei.  When they are added to the milk, they begin to break up the portions of the casein protein that sticks out of the micelle surface.  These portions of the protein are what keeps the the hydrophobic micelles floating around in the milk.  When they are removed, the micelles become incredibly unstable.  The only way for them to stabilize is to start interacting with each other, thereby reducing the amount of the micelle that is exposed to the rest of the milk.  This forms a gel matrix \u201cnet\u201d which traps all the very large fat globules floating around.  If properly done, the whey will be almost perfectly clear and all the curds will form a mass that floats at the top\n\n\n### Answer:\nanimal rennet </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Willy is a Pug, who appears in the first episode of the programme on 19 February 1985 and remains in the show until 14 May 1992. [PAR] Storylines [PAR] Willy is Ethel Skinner's (Gretchen Franklin) constant companion. She rarely appears on-screen without him tucked under her arm. He was named after her late husband, William Skinner (Ian Brimble). There were various innuendo-laden references to Willy.  Ethel's famous lines being either, \"Where's my Willy?\" or, in a double entendre, \"Has anyone seen my Willy?\" [PAR] Willy can often be quite mischievous. When Ethel is preparing the food in The Queen Victoria public house one day, Willy eats all the expensive steak for the steak and kidney pies when her back is turned. Ethel replaces the meat with a less costly cut and everyone comments that the pies were not up to standard. At Christmas 1990, he sneaks into the Fowlers' and begins eating the turkey.  [PAR] Willy is kidnapped in 1986. He is eventually found by Detective Roy Quick (Douglas Fielding) in a pet shop, but when Quick returns with Ethel, Willy has been sold. Willy is tracked down to his new owner, Mr. Pavasars, who has renamed him Rasputin. Lou Beale (Anna Wing) fetches him back and returns Willy to his rightful owner. When Ethel falls and breaks her hip, Willy stays with Dot Cotton (June Brown), and they find each other a strain. Dot isn't the only one who can't tolerate Willy. First Ernie Mears (Ken Wynne) and then Benny Bloom (Arnold Yarrow) want to marry Ethel, but only if she will get rid of Willy. Ethel can't part with her beloved dog so she turns them both down. [PAR] When Ethel and her friends go on a holiday to Clacton, Willy has to go too, in a holdall. He is discovered by the owner of the bed and breakfast, but fortunately for Ethel he is a dog-lover too and allows Willy to stay. [PAR] Willy is a touch sensitive, and when Dr. Harold Legg (Leonard Fenton) makes several remarks about \"dog mess\" in the Square, Ethel fears it upset him to the extent that he can't perform at all. Luckily, Willy's constipation is eventually resolved. [PAR] After succumbing to old-age, Willy falls ill in 1992 and Ethel has to make the heart-breaking decision to put him down. Ethel is devastated to lose her dog, so the residents of Albert Square raise money to buy her a new dog. However, Ethel won't accept it, saying Willy is irreplaceable.  [PAR] Two weeks and two days after being written out of EastEnders, the dog who played Willy died.  [PAR] Casting [PAR] Willy was cast less than a week before the filming of EastEnders began. From the beginning it was decided that the pensioner Ethel Skinner was to have a Yorkshire Terrier named Willy (after her dead husband). The company Janimals, who specialized in providing and training animals for television and films, was contacted by EastEnders co-creator/producer Julia Smith, and informed her that they could provide an experienced Pug for the part (he had previously starred in Swallows and Amazons). The dog was brought to the studio to meet Gretchen Franklin, the actress who played Ethel. She took a shine to him straight away and so the pug was cast as Willy. Willy and Roly the poodle shared a dressing room at Elstree Studios.[DOC] [TLE] Willy - EastEnders Wiki - WikiaWilly | EastEnders Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia [PAR] Ethel Skinner [PAR] Willy is a Pug that was owned by Ethel Skinner who was named after her husband William Skinner \u00a0after he passed away.

While he is a good actor, he had very little screentime, acted like a typical Hollwyood \"CIA Man,\" said \"brotha\" every other line, and dissapeared after the card game. Not to mention that I'm pretty sure Ian Fleming didn't have an actor of Wright's caliber in mind when he wrote the character. [PAR] We must have seen two different movies because Jeffrey Wright's Leiter never once said \"brotha.\" He did say \"brother\" twice which has a whole different meaning than what you're trying to imply. He used \"brother\" in the sense that he and Bond share the same profession and are from allied agencies hence the \"brother from Langley\" line. Langley, Virginia is where the CIA headquarters is. [PAR] 206 posts [PAR] Posted 28 February 2007 - 05:04 PM [PAR] I don't agree that Felix should be the American that matches Bond. He is always secondary in the books, and makes a few mistakes. I think Jack Lord and David Hedison are the best on-screen Leiters, but that the screenwriters have always used Leiter in the wrong role, a sort of by-the-book man who sympathises with Bond, which results in him telling the mischievous Bond off. [PAR] The most like the books is the unofficial (who cares if he's black) Bernie Casey, who actually does feel like a true friend to Bond, as well as being his equal, but not quite his equal.

The film stars Sean Connery, Donald Sutherland, and Lesley-Anne Down. [PAR] Plot [PAR] In 1854, Edward Pierce (Sean Connery), a charismatic member of London's high society, is secretly a master thief. He plans to steal a monthly shipment of gold from the London to Folkestone train which is meant as payment for British troops fighting in the Crimean War. The gold is heavily guarded in two heavy safes in the baggage car, each of which has two locks, requiring a total of four keys. Pierce recruits Robert Agar (Donald Sutherland), a pickpocket and screwsman. Pierce's mistress Miriam (Lesley-Anne Down) and his chauffeur Barlow (George Downing) join the plot, and a train guard, Burgess (Michael Elphick), is bribed into participation. The executives of the bank who arrange the gold transport, the manager Mr. Henry Fowler (Malcolm Terris) and the president Mr. Edgar Trent (Alan Webb), each possess a key; the other two are locked in a cabinet at the offices of the South Eastern Railway at the London Bridge train station. In order to hide the robbers' intentions, wax impressions are to be made of each of the keys. [PAR] Pierce ingratiates himself with Trent by feigning a shared interest in ratting. He also begins courting Trent's spinster daughter, Elizabeth (Gabrielle Lloyd), to learn the location of her father's key. Pierce and Agar successfully break into Trent's home at night, and make a wax impression of the key before making a clean getaway despite a close call with the butler.  [PAR] Pierce targets Fowler through his weakness for prostitutes. Miriam reluctantly poses as \"Madame Lucienne\", a high-class hooker in an exclusive bordello. Miriam meets Fowler and asks him to undress, forcing him to remove the key worn round his neck. While Fowler is distracted by Miriam, Agar makes an impression of his key. Pierce then arranges a phony police raid to rescue Miriam, forcing Fowler to flee to avoid a scandal. [PAR] The keys at the train station prove a much harder challenge. After a diversionary tactic with a child pickpocket fails to distract the guards, Pierce decides to use cat burglar Clean Willy (Wayne Sleep) to climb down from the ceiling and open the office doors from within. Because Clean Willy is incarcerated at Newgate Prison, Pierce and Agar first have to break him out, using a public execution as a distraction. With Willy's help, the criminals succeed in taking wax impressions of the keys when the night guard takes a scheduled restroom break. [PAR] Clean Willy is subsequently arrested following a botched pickpocketing attempt and informs on Pierce. The police use Willy to lure Pierce into a trap, but the master cracksman easily eludes capture. Clean Willy escapes from his captors but is murdered by Barlow on Pierce's orders.  The authorities, now aware that the robbery is imminent, increase security by having the baggage car padlocked from the outside until the train arrives at its destination and forbidding passengers to travel in the guard's van. Any container large enough to hold a man must be opened and inspected before it is loaded on the train. [PAR] Pierce smuggles Agar into the baggage car disguised as a corpse in a coffin.  Pierce plans to reach the car across the coach roofs while the train is under way, but he and Miriam encounter Fowler, who is riding the train to Folkestone to watch over the shipment. After arranging for Miriam to travel in the same compartment as Fowler to divert his attention, Pierce crosses the roof of the train and unlocks the baggage van's door from the outside.  He and Agar replace the gold with lead bars and toss the bags of gold off the train at a prearranged point. However, soot from the engine's smoke has stained Pierce's clothes and he is forced to borrow Agar's suit, which is much too small for him.

He had cardiovascular disease. [PAR] Mr. Laine sold more than 250 million records during a six-decade career. At his peak, he was a frequent presence on TV variety shows and had his own CBS program in the mid-1950s as a replacement for Arthur Godfrey. He was invited to perform at the world's top concert halls and nightclubs, including the London Palladium, New York's Copacabana and Las Vegas's Desert Inn. [PAR] Often playing himself, he starred in several musicals from the early 1950s, including \"Sunny Side of the Street\" and \"Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder.\" He sang the title songs of many western movies, including \"Man Without a Star\" starring Kirk Douglas and \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\" with Douglas and Burt Lancaster. [PAR] By the early 1960s, the rise of rock-and-roll music left Mr. Laine far from the vanguard of popular music. He toured widely in Europe and Australia and made commercials for Campbell's Soup, among other products. [PAR] In 1974, he unwittingly lampooned his own image by singing the theme song for Mel Brooks's western spoof \"Blazing Saddles\" over the opening credits. The song emphasized loud whipping sounds between otherwise innocuous lyrics (\"He rode a blazing saddle. He wore a shining star . . . \"). [PAR] Brooks later told a reporter, perhaps jokingly: \"You know, what's so sweet and so sad was that Frankie Laine sang it with all his heart. He didn't know [the movie] was a comedy. We got Frankie Laine because he'd done all these Western theme songs. With tears in his eyes he said to me, 'This is a beautiful song.' I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to tell him it was funny. He didn't get it.\" [PAR] The son of Sicilian-born parents, Francesco Paolo LoVecchio was born in Chicago on March 30, 1913. During the Depression, he began working and scrapping to support his family. He became a marathon dancer and claimed once to have danced for 145 days straight in Atlantic City when he was 17. He and his partner split the $1,000 prize. [PAR] His first professional singing date came unexpectedly during a marathon dance, when he launched into a highly emotional song called \"Beside an Open Fireplace.\" [PAR] \"They had called me up to entertain because there were only three couples left in this particular marathon, and none of them could sing or dance or tell jokes,\" he told the Chicago Tribune in 1990. When the audience reacted well, he was encouraged to try to earn money as a singer. [PAR] At one point, he took over Perry Como's singing spot with a Cleveland band, and he appeared on New York radio for $5 a week. He also was a machinist, a car salesman and a bar bouncer from Chicago to Baltimore. [PAR] To distinguish himself from the creamy-voiced crooners of the early 1940s, he developed a rhythmically charged performance style. This caused further problems. He said he was discriminated against because his voice \"sounded black.\" He told the Tribune \"there really was no market for a white kid who sounded black and didn't sing dreamy ballads.\" [PAR] In 1946, pop composer Hoagy Carmichael saw Mr. Laine one night at Billy Berg's Vine Street Club in Hollywood and heard his bluesy rendition of Carmichael's \"Rockin' Chair.\" Carmichael reportedly refused to leave until Berg agreed to retain Mr. Laine at a much higher salary -- $75 a\n\n\n### Answer:\nfrankie laine </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Twenty-five years ago on that fateful day in 1988, the creation from the mind palace of Rob Grant and Doug Naylor which introduced the world to the remaining on-board inhabitants of a mining spaceship owned and operated by the Jupiter Mining Corporation, became a reality with the premiere broadcast of Red Dwarf. The concept for the show was originally developed from the sketch-series Dave Hollins: Space Cadet which was part of the BBC Radio 4 show Son of Clich\u00e9 which was also written by Grant and Naylor. 25 years and 61 episodes later, Red Dwarf is an icon of British situation comedy history. [PAR] In 2008, The BBC opted to \u2018pursue other projects\u2019 and \u2018officially\u2019 rejected the possibility the series returning for a ninth series, some 9 years following the end of RDVIII in 1999. It was not to end, however, as Pitch, an international mobile entertainment company, working with series producers, created a Christmas \u2018mobisode\u2019 designed solely for users of the mobile medium. Months later, Dave \u2013 the home of witty banter \u2013 brought the series back for an Easter 2009 premiere of Red Dwarf: Back to Earth followed in 2012 by Red Dwarf X, recorded in front of a studio audience and the first full series since 1999.

That one episode performance was so strong that Mr. Flibble became the official interviewer on the Red Dwarf official website . Mr. Flibble was quite interested in Red Dwarf in the States, I think partly due to the fact that he was trying to calculate his residuals due for any past, present or future North American transmission. [PAR] Thankfully, Mr. Flibble was uncharacteristically kind that cold December day at Shepperton. It was only towards the end of the interview did I experience the full effect of his hex-vision powers as he became quite cross when our time was up. His final question cemented a bond between the two of us that would last a lifetime as he wanted to know my top-ten British pub names . Personally, I think he had been to most of them from the smile on his face as I began to list them. My full interview with Mr. Flibble is archived along with a number of far more amazing interviews on the series website. [PAR] So\u2026happy 25th Red Dwarf. You don\u2019t look a day over 21.

In this page we are going to take a more in-depth look at the female menstrual cycle, ovulation and periods. Obviously, no website can take the place of talking to a healthcare professional, but this should give you a good general understanding of how it all works. [PAR] Understanding your menstrual cycle [PAR] Women\u2019s cycle lengths vary, and the most common cycle length is somewhere between 23 and 35 days. Any variation in menstrual cycle length that does occur is more likely to be during the part of the cycle before you ovulate (which is called the follicular phase). For most women, the length of time between ovulation (when an egg is released from the ovary) and their monthly period is between 12 to 16 days (this is called the luteal phase). [PAR] The menstrual cycle [PAR] Your period [PAR] The first day of your menstrual cycle is the first day of your period (day 1). The period usually then lasts anything from 3 to 7 days. You\u2019ll probably find that if you get any period pains, they\u2019ll be at their worst in the first few days of your period. This is because the hormones in your body are causing your womb to actively shed the lining that was built up in the previous menstrual cycle. [PAR] Preparing for ovulation [PAR] At the beginning of your cycle follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is produced by the pituitary gland in your brain. This is the main hormone involved in stimulating your ovaries to produce mature eggs. Follicles are the fluid-filled cavities in your ovaries. Each follicle contains one undeveloped egg. The FSH stimulates a number of follicles to develop and start to produce the hormone estrogen. Your level of estrogen is at its lowest on the first day of your period. From then on, it starts to increase as the follicles grow. [PAR] Now while a number of follicles initially begin to develop, normally one follicle becomes \u201cdominant\u201d and this egg matures within the enlarging follicle. At the same time, the increasing amount of estrogen in your body makes sure that the lining of your womb is thickening with nutrients and blood. This is so that if you do get pregnant, the fertilised egg will have all the nutrients and support it needs to grow. High estrogen levels are also associated with the appearance of \u2018sperm-friendly\u2019 mucus (or, to give it its technical name, fertile cervical mucus). You may notice this as a thin, slippery discharge that may be cloudy white. Sperm can swim more easily through this mucus and can survive in it for several days. [PAR] Your body produces hormones which control your menstrual cycle. At the start of your cycle one important hormone is follicle stimulating hormone [FSH]. The rise in FSH stimulates the follicles in your ovaries [fluid filled cavities that each contain one undeveloped egg] to develop and to start to produce another hormone called estrogen. [PAR] Understanding the ovulation cycle [PAR] Ovulation [PAR] The level of estrogen in your body is still increasing and it eventually causes a rapid rise in luteinising hormone (the \u2018LH surge\u2019). This LH surge causes the dominant follicle to rupture and release the mature egg from the ovary, from where it enters the Fallopian tube. This process is known as ovulation. [PAR] Many women think that they ovulate on day 14, but 14 is an average, and most women will actually ovulate on a different day of the menstrual cycle. Your day of ovulation will vary from cycle to cycle.. Some women claim to feel a twinge of pain when they ovulate, but many feel no sensation at all and there\u2019s no other sign that you are ovulating. [PAR] An accurate way to identify your personal fertile days is to detect the changes in these key fertility hormones using an ovulation test . [PAR] Other commonly used methods to estimate when your most fertile days are for example, ovulation calendar methods, basal body temperature\n\n\n### Answer:\n1 </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Its greatest breadth, on the mainland, is about 28 miles (45 km), and its total length, from the Kvarner (Quarnero) gulf to the narrows of Kotor (Cattaro), is about 233 miles (375 km). The major islands from north to south (with Italian names in parentheses) are Krk (Veglia), Cres (Cherso), Rab (Arba), Pag (Pago), Dugi Otok (Isola Lunga), Bra\u010d (Brazza), Hvar (Lesina), Vis (Lissa), Kor\u010dula (Curzola), Mljet (Meleda), and Lastovo (Lagosta). A rugged and barren range of mountains, the Dinaric Alps, divides Dalmatia from the interior. With peaks ranging from 1,500 feet (450 m) to more than 6,200 feet (1,900 m), the Dinaric Alps offer only two main passes: the Krka River canyon and the Neretva River valley.

The Greeks began to settle there from the 4th century, founding a number of colonies on the islands, the most famous of which were Issa (Vis), Pharos (Hvar), and Corcyra Melaina (Kor\u010dula), and a few towns on the mainland coast, one of which is Salona (Solin), near modern Split. The Greeks, opposed by the Illyrians, appealed to the Romans for help, and a long series of Roman-Illyrian wars began in 229. The fall of the Dalmatian capital, Delminium, in 155 brought Roman civilization to the country. On the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, Dalmatia fell under the power of Odoacer in 481 ce and later under that of Theodoric, to become a battlefield during the wars between the Goths and the Byzantine emperor Justinian I .

The Giro started off in Amsterdam on 8 May and stayed in the Netherlands for three stages, before leaving the country.

Australian riders won all the lesser jersey awards, with Evans taking the points classification, 's Matthew Lloyd the winner of the mountains classification, and Richie Porte of  the Giro's best young rider. [PAR] The road race stages in the Netherlands were both marred by repeated crashes, which led to some unexpected big time gaps before the transfer to Italy. The overall standings were very turbulent in the first week, with four different riders holding the race leader's pink jersey. The 11th stage greatly re-shaped the overall standings, when several riders, including Sastre, gained almost 13\u00a0minutes against the remainder of the field. Porte took the pink jersey after this stage. Two days later, Arroyo took the jersey, and kept it for five days. He eventually lost it to Basso on the first of two very difficult mountain stages to close out the Giro.

[PAR] Arthur Ashe began playing tennis as a boy in his hometown of Richmond, Virginia. After winning a tennis scholarship to UCLA, Ashe was taken under the wing of tennis star Pancho Gonzales, who recognized the young player\u2019s potential. In 1968, Ashe became the first black man to win the U.S. Open. Two years later, he captured the Australian Open for his second Grand Slam title. Over the next seven years, Ashe won his share of tournaments, but no more majors, and, frustrated, he set his sights on victory at Wimbledon, one of the most celebrated championships in tennis. [PAR] Arthur Ashe was 31 years old in 1975, and seemingly well past his prime, so his advancement to the 1975 Wimbledon finals came as somewhat of a surprise to the tennis establishment. While Ashe\u2019s best finishes at Wimbledon had been losses in the semi-finals in 1968 and 1969, his opponent, the brash 22-year-old Jimmy Connors, was the defending Wimbledon champion. In their three previous meetings, Connors had handled Ashe easily. Furthermore, Connors was coming off an impressive semi-final win against Roscoe Tanner, whose intimidating serve observers called the hardest hitting ever at Wimbledon. [PAR] Though many thought he didn\u2019t have a chance, Ashe formulated a game plan for the match: hit nothing hard. He planned to serve strongly and then give Connors nothing but \u201cjunk\u201d as Ashe himself described it. Connors won the first game of the first set, but then dropped the rest of the set in just 20 minutes, 6-1. Although Connors won just one game off Ashe in the second set, he took the third set 7-5. His confidence restored, Connors strutted around the court, while Ashe closed his eyes between sets, concentrating on the moment at hand. Finally, with the shocked crowd cheering him on, Ashe finished Connors off in the fourth set, 6-4. [PAR] Ashe retired from competitive tennis in 1980 after suffering a heart attack. For his career, he won 51 tournaments. In retirement, Ashe wrote the three-volume book A Hard Road to Glory, first published in 1988, which detailed the struggle of black athletes in America. In 1983, after double-bypass surgery, Ashe was infected with HIV during a blood transfusion. After revealing his disease to the world in 1992, he set about educating the public about HIV and AIDS. He died of AIDS-related complications on February 6, 1993. In 1997, the U.S. Open\u2019s new home court was named Arthur Ashe Stadium.

[PAR] Wildcats is a quintessential 1980s high school sports comedy. The music, fashion, cars and hairstyles are all unmistakably 80s. Large boom boxes are on display in several scenes and a student mentions a \u201ccompact disc player\u201d at one point. It stars Goldie Hawn as a dissatisfied suburban Chicago high school girl\u2019s track coach. Her dream is to coach football. When the junior varsity coach gets sacked, she applies for the position. Instead she is offered the job of coaching the varsity team at a tough inner-city school. [PAR] The expected fish-out-of-water jokes (or more accurately white-woman-coaching-minority-boy\u2019s jokes) ensue. She gets off to a rough start but with tenacity she eventually earns the team\u2019s respect and leads them to the championship game against the high school where she was formerly employed. Yes the plot is unoriginal and predictable. Fortunately the cast, lead by the always hilarious Goldie, makes the most of this tried and true formula. [PAR] As was common in comedies from the 1980s, Wildcats features several nude scenes. Goldie Hawn appears naked in a bathtub with her tits exposed and there is even a glimpse of full frontal male nudity, courtesy of two of the boys on the football team (Wesley Snipes and Jsu Garcia). Although these actors were both adults at the time, I doubt if a movie today would show a female teacher being given the full monty by her students. At least not in such a nonchalant manner as depicted here. [PAR] Also typical of 1980s comedies is the casual mix of raunchy humor with a feel-good family message. Words like fuck and pussy are thrown around as often as a football on the practice field, yet the movie contains a valuable life lesson about perseverance. And the plot also deals with Goldie Hawn\u2019s battle with her ex-husband to keep custody of her two daughters. [PAR] The supporting cast features many familiar faces. This was the debut of Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson and the first of their movies together. Nipsey Russell plays the supportive high school principal. Swoosie Kurtz plays Hawn\u2019s loyal sister. Mykelti Williamson plays the all star quarterback. Audiences will remember him as Forrest Gump\u2019s best friend Bubba. LL Cool J makes a cameo during a party scene and performs the theme song. Old-timers Gloria (Titanic) Stuart and Ann Doran (she appeared in small roles in many classic films, dating back to the 1922 silent version of Robin Hood!) play the conservative women that interview Goldie for a job at a private school. An interview her ex-husband arranged and insisted upon. [PAR] Wildcats may be predictable and unoriginal but it\u2019s a wonderfully nostalgic time-capsule of the mid-80s and features a diverse and talented cast giving their all. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Reviewed on: September 24th, 2015 [PAR] Goldie Hawn and Michael Ritchie in an awkward publicity pose for Wildcats [PAR] Although the success of their careers was based on different variables, I have often put Raquel Welch, Barbra Streisand and Goldie Hawn in the same category. They were contemporaries who made films during a period of feminism. All made movies where their characters found themselves in a traditional male role. All three also made sports films. Welch was a roller derby girl; Streisand played a boxing manager and Hawn a high school football coach. All three played women who had to deal with being ogled and treated as a sex object while trying to prove they can do whatever a man can. These women were cursed by their femininity. While training with the football team, Hawn\u2019s Coach Molly McGrath has to suffer through sexual gestures and wondering eyes from her players. [PAR] The feminist point is hammered home when McGrath talks to her daughters about her job. One of them tells the other that she cannot be a helicopter pilot.

His father, who was also called Maurice, worked as a porter in a fish market, and his mother, Ellen, worked as a cook and a cleaning lady. When he was two-years-old, his brother, Stanley Victor, was born. [PAR] A sickly child, Caine was born suffering from rickets. He grew up in South London, and attended Ruskin Infant's School in Camberwell from the age of four. Around the same time, he was first introduced to the cinema and enjoyed going to see 'The Lone Ranger' at the Saturday morning children's matinee.\u00a0When World War II broke out in 1939, Michael and his little brother were briefly evacuated to Wargrave in Berkshire, but then returned to London to face the perils of 'the blitz'. Caine's mother then found accommodation for her family at North Runcton in Norfolk. US air bases were springing up all over the area, and it was here that young Michael was first introduced to chewing gum! [PAR] After the war, Caine attended Wilson's Grammar School in Camberwell but left at the age of 16 with four O levels. He then underwent his compulsory period of National Service, and served in the Royal Fusiliers in Germany; he also did a tour of combat duty during the Korean War.\u00a0After leaving the army, Caine's acting career began in Sussex, when he took a job as an assistant stage manager for the Westminster Repertory Company, which was based in Horsham. He then succeeded in securing a few walk-on roles at the Carfax Theatre, which gave him his first experience of stage acting. [PAR] He had now been bitten by the acting bug in earnest. During his early years as an aspiring actor, Caine shared a flat with fellow actor Terence Stamp: the two men became firm friends and have remained so ever since.\u00a0After a few minor TV appearances and walk-on roles at the Carfax Theatre, he got his first proper \"break\" as an upper-class British officer Gonville Bromhead in the film 'Zulu'. This was something of a breakthrough for Caine, as he epitomised the \"working class hero\" type of actor with his authentic cockney accent. [PAR] Moreover, it established him firmly as a leading player in the cinema and opened the door to a string of exciting offers during the 1960s. After the success of 'Zulu', he played two of his most famous roles: namely, the role of a roguish womaniser in 'Alfie' (1966), and the spy Harry Palmer in the film, 'The Ipcress File' (1965), a cold war thriller based on the novels of bestselling author Len Deighton.\u00a0Caine reprised the role of Palmer in two further movies, 'Funeral in Berlin' (1966) and 'Billion-Dollar Brain' (1967). [PAR] Although Caine had not yet achieved major success in Hollywood, it was not long before the offers started to pour in. He made his first film in America in 1966, after receiving an invitation from Shirley MacLaine to act alongside her in a movie called 'Gambit'. Whilst working on 'Gambit', Caine was also introduced to the screen idol John Wayne, who became one of his closest friends, as well as the agent Swifty Lazar.\u00a0The 1960s were a phenomenally successful time for Michael Caine, despite the fact that he did not win an Oscar. In 1969, he made yet another hit movie, 'The Italian Job', alongside the legendary actor Sir Noel Coward, and that same year, he played an RAF fighter pilot in the movie, 'Battle of Britain'. [PAR] As the 1970s dawned, he consolidated his hard-won screen success. In 1971, he made the movie 'Get Carter', a classic British gangster story. He then played opposite Sir Laurence Olivier, who was arguably the leading actor of his generation in the classic thriller, 'Sleuth'\n\n\n### Answer:\nitalian job </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Columbus and his entourage made their famous voyage aboard three ships: the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria. All three ships reached the New World at San Salvador in the Bahamas in October 1492. [PAR] what is a fallback [PAR] The Nina [PAR] The Nina's true name was the Santa Clara but, as with all Spanish ships, the tradition was to call a ship by the middle name of its owner. Juan Nino de Moguer owned the Nina . The Nina was reported to be the middle ship of the three as far as size and top speed with all ships ranging from 5 to 8 knots. The Nina was a caravel estimated to have been about 67 feet long, 21 feet across with 7 feet of draft and a weight of 50 to 60 tons . Vincent Yanez Pinzon was the captain of the Nina . [PAR] The Pinta [PAR] Like the Nina, the Pinta was a dual-masted caravel with a rear-mounted rudder and a single deck. The Nina and Pinta both had 25 crew members with only one cabin located below decks and out of the elements. Crew may otherwise sleep in the open or in the hold as they wished. The captain of the Pinta was named Martin Alonzo Pinzon from Moguer . The Pinta was the fastest of the three ships and was the first to actually sight the New World. Columbus did however take credit for the sighting. The nickname Pinta means \"painted one\" and it refers to the ship's appearance. [PAR] The Santa Maria [PAR] The Santa Maria was the flagship of the voyage and the largest by far, weighing around 100 tons. It was also the slowest of the three ships with dimensions of about 55 feet in length, a 36-foot keel, 18-foot beam and a 9-foot draft. The Santa Maria was a \"Nao\" or heavily built standard shipping vessel equipped for hauling freight but strong enough to cross oceans albeit at a slow pace. The ship's real name was La Gallega for its place of origin in Spain's northern region of Galicia. The Santa Maria carried Columbus on his voyage but was outpaced by both of the other ships. The Santa Maria had a crew of 39 sailors and it sank off Haiti on Christmas Eve 1492. [PAR] The Voyage [PAR] Columbus' voyage across the Atlantic was one of greatest navigational errors in history. He mistakenly found two new continents thinking that he had discovered a route to the Far East. Another explorer, Amerigo Vespucci, was responsible for fitting the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria with supplies for their Atlantic voyage. As part of the foodstuffs Vespucci stocked barrels of pickles which were salted for preservation and which turned out to have high levels of vitamin C. The result was an escape from the outbreak of scurvy which had cursed so many voyages of the time. North and South America were later named for this same man. According to The Long Island Press, Columbus has been genetically linked to the origins of syphilis on the European continent. The article also notes that Columbus was an opium addict and that painted images of the explorer are not actually based on his physical appearance but are merely artists' renderings.

It has been held at the All England Club in Wimbledon, London since 1877.  [PAR] Wimbledon is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, the others being the Australian Open, the French Open and the US Open. Since the Australian Open shifted to hardcourt in 1988, Wimbledon is the only major still played on grass. [PAR] The tournament takes place over two weeks in late June and early July, culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Final, scheduled always for the second Saturday and Sunday of July respectively. Five major, junior, and invitational events are held each year. Wimbledon traditions include a strict dress code for competitors and Royal patronage. The tournament is also notable for the absence of sponsor advertising around the courts. In 2009, Wimbledon's Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain. [PAR] History [PAR] Beginning [PAR] The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club is a private club founded on 23 July 1868, originally as \"The All England Croquet Club\". Its first ground was off Worple Road, Wimbledon.  [PAR] In 1876, lawn tennis, a game devised by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield a year or so earlier and originally given the name Sphairistik\u00e8, was added to the activities of the club. In spring 1877, the club was renamed \"The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club\" and signalled its change of name by instituting the first Lawn Tennis Championship. A new code of laws, replacing the code administered by the Marylebone Cricket Club, was drawn up for the event. Today's rules are similar except for details such as the height of the net and posts and the distance of the service line from the net. [PAR] The inaugural 1877 Wimbledon Championship opened on 9 July 1877. The Gentlemen's Singles was the only event held and was won by Spencer Gore, an old Harrovian rackets player, from a field of 22. About 200 spectators paid one shilling each to watch the final.  [PAR] The lawns at the ground were arranged so that the principal court was in the middle with the others arranged around it, hence the title \"Centre Court\". The name was retained when the Club moved in 1922 to the present site in Church Road, although no longer a true description of its location. However, in 1980 four new courts were brought into commission on the north side of the ground, which meant the Centre Court was once more correctly defined. The opening of the new No. 1 Court in 1997 emphasised the description. [PAR] By 1882, activity at the club was almost exclusively confined to lawn tennis and that year the word \"croquet\" was dropped from the title. However, for sentimental reasons it was restored in 1899.

However, a working model was not built. The picture shows the patent for this type of escalator. [PAR] Leamon Souder got at least 4 patents for escalators, 2 for spiral escalators in 1889, but working models were not built. [PAR] Jesse W. Reno patented the cleat-type escalator in 1892. [PAR] George A. Wheeler patented the step-type escalator in 1892. He never built a step-type escalator, but the patents were sold to Charles Seeberger. [PAR] Jesse W. Reno installed the world's first escalator in 1896, at the Coney Island Old Island Pier in New York, NY. [PAR] Jesse W. Reno tried his escalator out again, by installing it at the Brooklyn Bridge in New York, NY. He removed the escalator a month later, after he was done testing it there. [PAR] Jesse W. Reno joined Otis Elevator Co , then retired later, after selling the patents to Otis Elevator Co. [PAR] Charles Seeberger started drawing an escalator model in 1895. This escalator model was different from modern escalators, as the escalator becomes flat at the end, where you get off sideways, and then there is most likely an angled combplate, though it is not safe to stay on the escalator at the end. [PAR] Piat made another type of escalator, consisting of a leather belt, in many pieces, attached together. A working model was installed at Harrods, London, United Kingdom, in 1898. [PAR] In 1899, Charles Seeberger joined Otis. [PAR] In 1900, the first commercially-sold escalator, and first step-type escalator was installed by Otis at the Paris 1900 Exposition Universelle, in Paris, France. The escalator won first prize. Other types of escalators were also on display. [PAR] Hall\u00e9 made a different type of escalator. [PAR] George A. Wheeler made plans for another type of spiral escalator in 1905. [PAR] Jesse W. Reno installed a spiral cleat-type? escalator in 1906. However, it was never opened to the public. [PAR] Hocquardt got a patent for a different type of escalator in 1906. [PAR] Hocquardt later went out of business. [PAR] Charles Seeberger invented at least 2 more types of spiral escalators between 1906-1911, but models were never built. [PAR] Escalators were marketed under different names by other companies, as the name Escalator was trademarked by Otis, such as Peelle Motorstair, Westinghouse Electric Stairway, and Haughton Moving Stairs. [PAR] Gilbert Luna patented another type of spiral escalator in 1973, but a model was never built. A company to manufacture this product was most likely not found. [PAR] Mitsubishi installed the first modern spiral escalator in 1985. [PAR] Helixator, another type of spiral escalator, is more compact. A full size model does not exist, but there is a working scale model. [PAR] Nowadays, Schindler sells more escalators than any other company, and Otis does not sell as many escalators anymore, making Schindler as the largest escalator manufacturer in the world. [PAR] Types of escalators [PAR] Step type escalator [PAR] The step type escalator is the common type of escalator today. The steps are usually metal, but very old step type escalators had wooden steps. Step type escalators can also go up/down, flat, then up/down again. On Otis Next Step escalators, the escalator steps are mounted on most likely hinged circles, and the track appears to be besides the steps, visible from above the steps.

Harry is horrified, and is taunted endlessly. He spends most of his time in the library with Hermione, who is profoundly bothered that Viktor Krum has taken to studying there, drawing along with him a gaggle of admirers. During a Hogsmeade visit, Harry wears his Invisibility Cloak in hope of attaining some anonymity, but Mad-Eye Moody spies him through it and points him out to Hagrid, who tells him to come to his cabin that night at midnight. Harry does as he is told. Invisibly, he follows Hagrid, who escorts Madame Maxime deep into the Forbidden Forest, where several dozen men, including Charlie Weasley, are trying to subdue four dragons. Harry overhears Charlie tell Hagrid that each dragon is a nesting mother, and that the four champions are to get past the dragons as their first task-he notes that one of them, a Hungarian Horntail, is significantly more dangerous than the rest. [PAR] Harry dashes off to meet Sirius in the common room at one, and he trips over Karkaroff, who is walking speedily through the woods, presumably in attempt to investigate the first task for himself. Right on time, Sirius's head is sitting in the Gryffindor fireplace. Harry tells him everything, and in return Sirius warns Harry that Karkaroff had been a Death-Eater who ultimately was caught by Moody. Sirius says that Moody was the best Auror in history, and is now at Hogwarts for a reason. Furthermore, he suggests that the fiasco with the dustbins may actually have been legitimate; someone may have tried to stop Moody from coming to Hogwarts. Lastly, Sirius notes that Bertha Jorkins was last seen in Albania, oddly enough, where Voldemort was last sighted; he may have used her for information and disposed of her. Before Sirius can advise Harry on how to get past a dragon, Ron walks into the common room, and Sirius disappears in the flames. Harry is furious at this interruption and throws a \"Potter Stinks\" badge at Ron's face before charging up to bed. [PAR] Chapter Twenty: The First Task [PAR] Summary [PAR] As the first task nears, Harry and Hermione research ways to subdue dragons, but to no avail; Harry is terrified and considers leaving Hogwarts, but decides against it when faced with the alternative of returning to the Dursleys. The day before the task, Harry warns Cedric about the dragons, since the other champions must have heard from their school-heads by now. Cedric is suspicious, and Moody pulls Harry aside afterwards and commends his decency in evening out the field. Then he advises Harry to play to his strengths, nodding when Harry muses aloud \"Quidditch.\" Harry realizes through this conversation that he must fly past the dragon, and therefore he must have his Firebolt broomstick. He and Hermione spend the rest of the day and night practicing the summoning charm, \"Accio!\" [PAR] The morning of the task, the four nervous champions are led into a tent in the forest, allowed to pluck from a bag a model of the dragon they are to fight, and told that their goal is to get the golden egg. Harry is to go fourth and fight the Hungarian Horntail. He listens as the crowd reacts to the work of the other three champions, and when his turn comes, he walks into the enclosure, summons his broomstick, and flies around the dragon, feeling at ease for the first time in the whole tournament\n\n\n### Answer:\npigwidgeon </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

The INR is a managed float, allowing the market to determine the exchange rate. As such, intervention is used only to maintain low volatility in exchange rates. [PAR] Early Coinage of India [PAR] India was one of the first issuers of coins, circa 6th Century BC, with the first documented coins being called 'punch-marked' coins because of the way they were manufactured. India's coinage designs frequently changed over the next few centuries as various empires rose and fell. By the 12th century a new currency referred to as Tanka was introduced. During the Mughal period, a unified monetary system was established and the silver Rupayya or Rupee was introduced. The states of pre-colonial India minted their coins with a similar design to the silver Rupee with variations depending on their region of origin. [PAR] Currency in British India [PAR] In 1825, British India adopted a silver standard system based on the Rupee and was used until the late 20th century. Although India was a colony of Britain, it never adopted the Pound Sterling . In 1866, financial establishments collapsed and control of paper money was shifted to the British government, with the presidency banks being dismantled a year later. That same year, the Victoria Portrait series of notes was issued in honor of Queen Victoria, and remained in use for approximately 50 years. [PAR] The Modern Day Indian Rupee [PAR] After gaining its independence in 1947 and becoming a republic in 1950, India's modern Rupee (INR) was changed back to the design of the signature coin. The Indian Rupee was adopted as the country's sole currency, and the use of other domestic coinage was removed from circulation. India adopted a decimalization system in 1957. [PAR] In 2016, the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 ceased to be legal tender in India. The removal of the denominations is an attempt to stop corruption and illegal cash holdings. In November of the same year, the Reserve Bank of India began issuing \u20b9 2000 denomination banknotes in the Mahatma Gandhi (New) Series.

India currency is issued and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. [PAR] About India Currency [PAR] Conceptually, the contemporary Indian rupee can be split up into 100 paisa or paise. In spite of the fact this split is purely emblematic; the coin of 50 paise will be the lowest denomination to be acknowledged in the market since June 30, 2011. Denominations under 50 paise will end to be legitimate currency. [PAR] In India, the bank notes are issued in various denominations such as 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 rupees. Coins are issued in the denominations of 1, 2, 5 and 10 rupees and 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25 and 50 paise. The Indian rupee sign has originated from the Devanagari consonant (Ra) and there is an extra flat line. There is no happenstance that the sign may also have been originated from the Latin consonant \"R\" by taking away the perpendicular bar, and including two parallel lines, since both languages have their origins in Sanskrit (like in relation to Euro and Yen signs). [PAR] The opening set of coins with the rupee sign was issued on July 8, 2011. [PAR] It is noteworthy that dissimilar to China, consecutive directions (via RBI, the apex bank) have not abided a strategy of pegging the Indian rupee to a particular international currency at a specific swap rate. The involvement of the Reserve Bank of India in money markets is exclusively to render reduced instability in the exchange rates, and not to adopt a standpoint on the rate or trend of the Indian currency with respect to other currencies.

In Kenneth Branagh\u2019s 1997 film of Hamlet, his Polonius was praised by one critic for its \u201cconspiratorial edge\u201d. [PAR] In The Good Life Briers played the hapless Tom Good, a draughtsman who decided to abandon the office rat race and live off the land. Instead of moving to the country, however, he and his wife Barbara (Felicity Kendal) eviscerated the lawn at their suburban home, planted vegetables and kept livestock \u2014 all to the horror of their relentlessly middle-class next door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter (Penelope Keith and Paul Eddington). [PAR] With his omnipresent grin and boyish mannerisms, Briers proved perfect for the role. The Goods\u2019 attempts to be truly self-sufficient were constantly thwarted by the machinations of the snobbish Margo, who feared that they were lowering the tone of the neighbourhood beyond repair; but Tom and Barbara always laughed in the face of adversity, and never lost their affection for their tormentor. [PAR] Written by John Esmonde and Bob Larbey and screened in 30 episodes between 1975 and 1978, The Good Life was probably Briers\u2019s most famous vehicle on television. It was \u201ca happy and somewhat rare combination of intelligent writing and superb playing\u201d, judged the television critic of The Daily Telegraph. [PAR] From 1984 to 1987 Briers starred in another popular sitcom, Ever Decreasing Circles. Also written by Esmonde and Larbey, it featured an obsessive, middle-aged fusspot whose settled routine is unexpectedly threatened by a flashy rival for his wife\u2019s affections.

Yet with his sense of timing, air of hapless innocence and his ability to keep the straightest of faces amid the mayhem typical of his brand of embarrassed humour, it was no great surprise that Briers went on to become one of Britain\u2019s leading practitioners of farce and light comedy. [PAR] Briers continued to be offered television work, and starred as the Rev Philip Lambe in All In Good Faith (1985-88). Lambe, the former vicar of an affluent rural parish, had to knuckle down to life in a tough Midlands city and meet its challenging problems.

The arch was built in honour of Napoleon's victories. At 50 m high and 45 m wide, the rooftop observation deck offers a spectacular view of Paris.[DOC] [TLE] The Arc de Triomphe - Caloundra City Life Saving Club Incfrancofiles french icons arc de triomphe [PAR] About Napoleon [PAR] Napoleon Bonaparte was Emperor of France between 1796 and 1815. [PAR] It was he who commissioned the Arc de Triomphe. Napoleon started his career as a private in the army and quickly rose through the ranks because of his intelligence and ability to command. His men greatly respected his leadership and his decisions. [PAR] As a General, Napoleon led the French army against most of the other countries in Europe. When he became Emperor of France, he continued to lead his armies successfully in Europe and in Egypt, winning nearly every battle. It was Emperor Napoleon who wanted to construct a monument to commemorate his victorious armies and the conquests of France during his reign. [PAR] Napoleon's run of luck came to an end after his misjudged invasion of Russia in 1812. This was a failure and hundreds of thousands of French soldiers died in the cold. During his last battle,  at Waterloo in 1815, he was captured by British and Prussian (German) allies. He was exiled to a lonely island, St Helena, in the South Atlantic where he died a sad, solitary man, a few years later. [PAR] Why the Arc de Triomphe was built. [PAR] Napoleon Bonparte was a very successful soldier-Emperor who conquered most of Europe during the early nineteenth century. [PAR] He considered how he could construct a monument which would help people to remember, not only him, but also the conquests his armies had achieved and their bravery in the battles that they had fought. During his travels, Napoleon had seen and admired the triumphal arches built by the Romans eighteen hundred years before. These Roman triumphal arches were constructed for victorious Roman Emperors who paraded  through the arch with all their troops,  captives and spoils of war after successful campaigns. [PAR] Napoleon rather liked this idea. He oversaw the design and ordered the Arch to be built in 1806. It was designed to be a landmark in the capital city. It was meant to be the part of the Triumphal way from Versailles into Paris, leading through to the Louvre, which was the ancient palace of the French kings. But before it had risen many metres above ground level, the architect died (in 1811). [PAR] This, combined with Napoleon's military failures in his last few years as Emperor, meant that the Arch was never completed while Napoleon was alive. He never saw his dream become a reality and was never able to use it!  The Arc de Triomphe was  not completed until 1836, many years after Napoleon's death. [PAR] Visiting the Arc de Triomphe. [PAR] Around the Arc de Triomphe is the Place Charles de Gaulle. Charles de Gaulle was a hero and President of France. Place Charles de Gaulle  is a huge roundabout, many lanes wide. It used to be known as the \"Place de L'\u00c9toile\", or \"Star\". This is because, from this roundabout, twelve avenues reach into the distance, forming an elegant twelve pointed \"star\". When Baron Haussmann re-designed the centre of Paris, he wanted the Arc de Triomphe to be the focus point from as many places as possible and the central destination to which the most important roads led. [PAR] To reach the Arch, you need to take the subway passage under the roundabout. The roundabout has the reputation of being one of the most difficult to navigate in France because of the traffic. [PAR] The Arc de Triomphe is free for every one to visit. However, if you want to climb to the top, you have to purchase a ticket. Be prepared for a long climb up the steep spiral staircase!

[PAR] The disaster was the world's deadliest tsunami , with over 230,000 people killed and half a million injured by the waves that battered the low-lying coast. The exact death toll is unknown. [PAR] David Long, marine geohazards team leader for the British Geological Survey, told IBTimes UK there were many factors that made it one of the worst disasters in modern history . One of the main problems was that people were just not prepared for it.

The magnitude 9.1 earthquake struck 30km below the surface around 160km off the western coast of northern Sumatra. The Burma plate subducted below the Indian plate, with the latter being thrust upwards 20m. Rather than small sections of the plate shifting, a stretch of 1,200km suddenly moved.

[PAR] The wave itself was only about 50cm high but it was extremely long \u2013 about 500km \u2013 and was travelling at about the same speed as a jet airliner. While a boat in the ocean would hardly have noticed it passing, as it entered shallower water near coastlines, it started to slow and build. Waves of up to 15m hit the coastlines of Sumatra, Thailand, India and Sri Lanka, with another report saying the tsunami reached up to 30m in some areas. [PAR] The waves travelled about two kilometres inland in some areas. The reason the waves were so devastating was that much of the coast affected was very low-lying, so the water could continue to travel inland, wrecking everything in its path. The tsunami was travelling with so much energy it went as far as 5,000km to Africa, where it still had enough force to destroy property and kill people. [PAR] An overview shows Meulaboh city under water 28 December 2004AFP [PAR] In total, 14 countries were affected by the disaster. These were India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Maldives, Myanmar, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bangladesh, South Africa, Madagascar, Kenya, Tanzania and the Seychelles. Up to five million people were affected by the tsunami. [PAR] Over 500,000 people were injured by the tsunami, with a further 150,000 at risk from infectious diseases in the aftermath. The exact death toll is unknown, but over 230,000 are believed to have been killed with thousands more missing. Indonesia was worst affected, with an estimated 170,000 dead.

This was to be sold under the Bond name as the \"Bond Bug\". Introduced in June 1970, the early Bond Bugs were manufactured at the Bond factory in Preston but shortly afterwards when the factory closed, Bug production was moved over to Reliant at Tamworth. (UK) The Bond Bug used all the mechanics of a Reliant Regal including the 700 cc water-cooled engine though supported a new chassis that was later used for the Reliant Robin. The only non-Regal part was the coil spring suspension at the rear of the car (instead of the Regal's telescopic damper.) The Bug featured a complete glass fibre body in a futuristic wedge shape that had a lift up front canopy that incorporated the side windows and allowed access to the vehicle. Every Bug that was made was painted bright orange with black seats and trim though it is believed that several were also painted white and lime green for promotional use. [PAR] The vehicle came in three specifications; the 700, 700E and 700ES. The 700 was the standard model that featured none of the luxuries found on other models. This resulted in a prop being used to hold open the body and no side screens. The 700E was the deluxe version that included a telescopic canopy damper, side screens, heater, and a number of extra internal features though a spare wheel was still classed as an extra. The 700ES was the same as the 700E but was powered by a higher compression engine and featured a spare wheel, wing mirrors, mud flaps and a racing steering wheel amongst many other additional features. [PAR] In 1973 at the same time as the launch of the 750 Reliant Robin the Bond Bug 700 models were discontinued in favour of the new 750cc engine. Two new models came out which were the Bond Bug 750E and 750ES which apart from the larger engine were almost identical to their 700cc predecessors.\u00a0 The Bond Bug however was not as successful as Reliant had hoped and so after some 2,268 vehicles were built manufacture stopped in May 1974, which also brought an end to the Bond name [PAR] 1970 Bond Bug 700ES[DOC] [TLE] Bond - Bond Bug (1970-74) - motor-car.co.ukBond - Bond Bug (1970-74) [PAR] Bond Bug [PAR] Reliant 700 cc, later 750 cc [PAR] Transmission [PAR] 6\u00a0ft\u00a05\u00a0in (1,956\u00a0mm) [PAR] Length [PAR] 9\u00a0ft\u00a02\u00a0in (2,794\u00a0mm) [PAR] Width [PAR] 4\u00a0ft\u00a07\u00a0in (1,397\u00a0mm) [PAR] Height [PAR] 4\u00a0ft\u00a02\u00a0in (1,270\u00a0mm) [PAR] Curb\u00a0weight [PAR] Tom Karen (Ogle Design) [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] The Bond Bug is a small British two-seat, three-wheeled sports car built from 1970 to 1974.

Following the purchase of Bond Cars Ltd., Reliant commissioned Tom Karen of Ogle Design to design a fun car. The Bond Bug was based on Chief Engineer John Crosthwaite's newly designed chassis\u00a0and some Reliant Regal running gear. The original concept was explored by chopping down a production Regal vehicle. [PAR] The engine is the front-mounted 700\u00a0cc (later uprated to 750\u00a0cc) Reliant light-alloy four-cylinder unit which protruded into the passenger cabin.

It shows paratroops, gliders and troop carriers landing in France behind the German lines a day prior to the main invasion on June 6th, the D-Day, helping to prepare the way for the Allied invasion of Normandy. [PAR] Historical background: [PAR] Operation Overlord was the code name for the invasion of Normandy, the Allied operation that launched the successful invasion of German-occupied Western Europe in 1944. The operation commenced on 6 June 1944 with the Normandy landings (Operation Neptune, commonly known as D-Day). A 1,200-plane airborne invasion preceded the amphibious landing involving more than 5,000 vessels. Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on 6 June, and more than three million allied troops were in France by the end of August. [PAR] The decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion in 1944 was taken at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943. General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed commander of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, and General Bernard Montgomery was named as commander of the 21st Army Group, which comprised all the land forces involved in the invasion. The Normandy coast was chosen as the site of the invasion, with the Americans assigned to land at Utah and Omaha Beaches, the British at Sword and Gold Beaches, and Canadians at Juno Beach. German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was placed in charge of developing fortifications all along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an invasion. [PAR] The Allies failed to reach their goals for the first day, but gained a tenuous foothold that they gradually expanded as they captured the port at Cherbourg on 26 June and the city of Caen on 21 July. A failed counteraction by German forces on 8 August led to 50,000 soldiers of the German 7th Army and the Fifth Panzer Army being encircled by the Allies in the Falaise pocket. The Allies launched an invasion of southern France (Operation Dragoon) on 15 August, and the Liberation of Paris followed on 25 August. German forces retreated across the Seine on 30 August 1944, marking the close of Operation Overlord. [PAR] About the American airborne landings in Normandy: [PAR] The American airborne landings in Normandy were the first United States operations during Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy by the Western Allies on June 6, 1944. Around 13,100 American paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne and 101st Airborne Divisions made night parachute drops early on D-Day, June 6, followed by 3,937 glider troops flown in by day. As the opening maneuver of the Normandy landings (Operation Neptune) the American airborne divisions were delivered to the continent in two parachute and six glider missions. [PAR] Both divisions were part of the U.S. VII Corps and provided it support in its mission of capturing Cherbourg as soon as possible to provide the Allies with a port of supply. The specific missions of the airborne divisions were to block approaches into the vicinity of the amphibious landing at Utah Beach, to capture causeway exits off the beaches, and to establish crossings over the Douve River at Carentan to assist the U.S. V Corps in merging the two American beachheads. [PAR] The action did not succeed in blocking the approaches to Utah for three days. Numerous factors played a part, most of which dealt with excessive scattering of the drops. Despite this, German forces were unable to exploit the chaos. Many German units made a tenacious defense\n\n\n### Answer:\noperation overlord </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] See More[DOC] [TLE] Hever Castle, Edenbridge, Kent | Castles UncoveredHever Castle, Edenbridge, Kent | Castles Uncovered [PAR] Castle Glossary [PAR] Hever Castle [PAR] Hever Castle is a romantic 13th Century castle with a wet moat and beautiful landscaped gardens. It was associated with not one, but two of King Henry VIII's wives. Anne Boleyn lived out her childhood here and later Anne of Cleves was given Hever as part of her settlement. [PAR] Hever Castle sits beside the River Eden, just east of Edenbridge. It was first constructed in 1270 when it consisted of a gatehouse and walled bailey. [PAR] In 1340 a licence to crenellate was granted to William de Hever. It is unclear how much work he did because a second licence was granted to Sir John de Cobham in 1384. [PAR] In 1460 Geoffrey Bullen, Lord Mayor of London and great-grandfather of Anne Boleyn acquired the castle. By this point the castle's structure had deteriorated and was in need of repair. [PAR] Manor House fit for a Queen [PAR] Geoffrey Bullen built a Tudor manor within the castle's walls. It is a simple, square enclosure with Tudor windows punctuating its walls and Tudor chimneys and gables. [PAR] The front of the castle is dominated by the oblong gatehouse with its slightly off-centre entrance. Inside the gate passage there are two wooden portcullises and the front corners have square towers projecting out. [PAR] Inside the small courtyard there are, now heavily-restored, Tudor timber ranges on three sides. [PAR] It is uncertain when Anne came to Hever Castle. It's possible that she was born here, but the parish records are incomplete and even the date of her birth is debated among historians. She did spend her childhood here and only left in 1513 to further her education at the court of Archduchess Margaret of Austria. [PAR] In January 1522 she was back at Hever and she would be back and forth from Hever to King Henry's court quite frequently. [PAR] In 1526 King Henry VIII started his pursuit of Anne. He often stayed at nearby Bolebroke Castle to be near the object of his affection. At first Anne spurned his advances \u2013 she didn't want to be a mere mistress. She must have been persuaded however as she took on a greater role at court. Eventually, of course, becoming queen consort to Henry in 1533 when she moved in to Greenwich Palace. [PAR] After Anne's execution Hever Castle became the property of the crown. In 1540 Henry bestowed the castle to Anne of Cleves as part of her settlement. [PAR] After this the castle passed through a number of hands until it came into the possession of the Meade Waldo family. Again the castle was starting to fall into disrepair and the castle was let out to various tenants. [PAR] Full Restoration [PAR] In 1903 the American millionaire William Astor bought over the castle and its estate and set about an extensive programme of renovation and building. [PAR] He created the mock Tudor village beside the castle and built the beautiful gardens and lake. He restored the timber ranges and interiors. He didn't change the exterior and it is still authentic. [PAR] In 1983 Broadland Properties took over the running of Hever and opened it to the public. The castle is run as a tourist attraction. It has a range of shops, cafe and restaurants. [PAR] The castle rooms have been restored to their Tudor magnificence with 16th Century furniture, tapestries and portraits. Hever's connection to Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn is celebrated and they even have two prayer books signed by Anne herself. [PAR] Outside the castle there are award-winning ornamental gardens, an adventure playground and mazes to be navigated. The gardens are home to regular jousting competition, archery, and a summer theatre festival. [PAR] In addition Hever Castle offers luxury bed and breakfast accommodation and can cater for corporate hospitality, wedding events and groups and parties.

[PAR] Personality [PAR] Rodney's personality was based on the experiences of series creator John Sullivan, who also had an older sibling and claimed to have been, like Rodney, a dreamer and an idealist in his youth. [PAR] Dave? [PAR] The nickname 'Dave' is bestowed upon him by the character Trigger, the only character to refer to him as such, and was born from a one line joke in the very first episode, Big Brother. This became a long-standing joke throughout the entire series. [PAR] Personal life [PAR] It is revealed in numerous episodes such as \"Big Brother\", \"The Long Legs of the Law\", and \"A Royal Flush\" that Rodney is embarrassed about Del's antics, including lying to girls they want to date. In \"Yuppy Love\", he lied to a new girlfriend, Cassandra, that he lived in the posh street 'Kings Avenue', in order to impress her; however, she later found out where he lived when she phoned Nelson Mandela House. Del often asks Rodney questions, saying 'You're the one with GCEs!'. It is implied in \"The Frog's Legacy\", that Freddie Robdal is Rodney's real dad, when rumours start to emerge about the likeness between him and Rodney. [PAR] Del claimed in \"Mother Nature's Son\" that Rodney was still being breast fed until he was three and a half years old. As a child, Rodney was \"all snot and Marmite\" with a \"funny haircut\". Unlike Del, Rodney went to grammar school, where he passed GCEs in Art and Mathematics. He was subsequently expelled from an Art College in Basingstoke for smoking cannabis. In the early episodes, Rodney was troubled by this, and also by the fact that he had a very poor job and lived in a very grotty flat. He was worried that he would never find independence, which he really did long for. When he met Cassandra, it gave him a chance to move on in life, which resulted in his leaving Del behind. (This was conveyed in \"Little Problems\", at the end, when everyone had left the wedding reception and Del was standing all on his own, holding the groom from the wedding cake). [PAR] In later episodes, the only thing that troubled Rodney was his nephew Damien, whom he had recurring nightmares about. He was convinced that he was going to be the son of Satan, being named Damien did not help matters at all, (even though it was Rodney's bright idea that he was named Damien in the first place). The fact that Trigger had been calling him \"Dave\" since 1981 was no help. He did not know that Rodney was called Rodney, he always called him \"Dave\". No matter how many opportunities Trigger had to realise that \"Dave\" was not Rodney's name, he continued to call him Dave. One instance was in \"Three Men, a Woman and a Baby\", Rodney tells Trigger that if Del and Raquel's baby is a boy, they will name it Rodney after him. Trigger then tells Mike (who is holding a \"Guess the baby name\" competition) that \"If it's a boy, they're naming it Rodney, after Dave\".  Another instance was portrayed in \"Modern Men\", when Mike (the landlord at the Nags Head pub), announced a toast to future Mum and Dad \"Cassandra and Rodney\"; everyone said \"Cassandra and Rodney\", but Trigger could be heard shouting \"Dave\" after everyone else stops talking. In \"Homesick (Only Fools and Horses)\", Rodney did tell Trigger in his face that his name was \"Rodney\" and not \"Dave\",  yet despite this he continues to address him as 'Dave' and even refers to him as this, when he is not around.

[PAR] With Martin Clunes about to star in a new TV version of Goodbye Mr Chips, Timothy Carroll probes the origins of this enduring character [PAR] Another incarnation: Martin Clunes plays the beloved schoolteacher in ITV's forthcoming adaptation of Goodbye Mr Chips\u00a0 [PAR] Timothy Carroll [PAR] 12:01AM GMT 09 Dec 2002 [PAR] He is one of the most endearing creations of modern fiction. The crusty old boarding school master as devoted to his boys as they are to him, Mr Chips has enchanted generations of readers. Even in retirement, Chips treats every boy in turn to tea and cakes at his lodgings opposite the gates of Brookfield School. The luckiest boy of all is the one who is the last to visit him there, and can forever boast: \"I said good-bye to Chips the night before he died.\" [PAR] Chips's defining moment comes during the Great War when he is taking the lower fourth in Latin. A Zeppelin raid threatens to bring proceedings to a close, but Chips doesn't turn a hair. Instead, he suggests that the boys address their attentions to a particular passage in their texts that recalls how the Germans had been making a confounded nuisance of themselves as long ago as Caesar's time. \"You cannot judge the importance of things by the noise they make,\" he sniffs as the crash of explosives becomes louder. \"These things that have mattered for a thousand years are not going to be snuffed out because some stink-merchant invents a new kind of mischief.\" [PAR] Mr Chips was the creation of James Hilton, writer of Lost Horizon and one of the most prolific novelists of the 1930s and 1940s. Explaining that pivotal episode in his most famous work, Hilton later wrote: \"Better to learn and forget our Latin verbs than to learn and remember our experimental chemistry; better by far that we should forget and smile than that we should remember and be sad. My Mr Chips was aware that he was 'wasting' the possibly last moments of himself and his pupils, but he believed that at any rate he was wasting them with dignity and without malice.\" [PAR] The popularity of Chips suggests that there is an overwhelming admiration for the sort of quiet integrity he embodies. The book that immortalised him has never been out of print. There have been dozens of stage and radio adaptations, two Hollywood films, and a television drama. Now Martin Clunes is set to recreate Chips once more, in an ITV adaptation. It will be intriguing to see how the star of Men Behaving Badly interprets this very dignified role. [PAR] Was there a \"real\" Mr Chips who inspired Hilton? That was the very question the actor Robert Donat asked Hilton when he was rehearsing for the 1939 film directed by Sam Wood. Hilton's response was equivocal. There were several possible sources, he replied, including his father, John Hilton.

Mildly eccentric, he was the headmaster of a Walthamstow school. He was a strict disciplinarian, as Chips was (though the screen versions have tended to make him a more syrupy character). And, like Chips, he had some progressive ideas for his time. One was that, when he decided that his son would go to public school at the age of 15, the boy should make his own mind up which school he went to.

Travolta earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his performance as 19-year-old Tony Manero, who during the week toils in a Brooklyn, New York hardware store and on the weekend dons a white suit and becomes king of a discotheque called 2001 Odyssey. Tony takes great care in his appearance, at one point during the film uttering the now-famous line: \u201cWould ya just watch the hair. Ya know, I work on my hair a long time and you hit it. He hits my hair.\u201d Music played an essential role in Saturday Night Fever, and the film\u2019s soundtrack, which featured a number of songs by the Bee Gees, including \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive,\u201d \u201cNight Fever,\u201d \u201cHow Deep is Your Love\u201d and \u201cJive Talkin,\u201d became one of the best-selling soundtracks of all time. Saturday Night Fever was one of Gene Siskel\u2019s favorite films. The prominent film critic (who died in 1999) reportedly watched the movie at least 17 times and even purchased the now-iconic white polyester suit Travolta wore while strutting across the lighted dance floor. [PAR] Prior to Saturday Night Fever, John Travolta, who was born on February 18, 1954, in Englewood, New Jersey, appeared in the 1976 horror film Carrie, starring Sissy Spacek, and the 1976 made-for-TV movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble. He was best known, however, for his role as Vinnie Barbarino, a remedial high school student who employs the catchphrase \u201cUp your nose with a rubber hose\u201d on the TV sitcom Welcome Back Kotter, which originally aired from 1975 to 1979. After Saturday Night Fever propelled him to international stardom, Travolta followed up with another huge box-office hit, the 1978 big-screen adaptation of the musical Grease. In his role as 1950s-era bad boy Danny to co-star Olivia Newton-John\u2019s good girl Sandy, Travolta charmed audiences with his singing and dancing. Grease was the highest-grossing film of 1978 as well as the highest-grossing movie musical of all time. Following Grease, Travolta helped spark another craze\u2013this time for country music\u2013with the 1980 box-office hit Urban Cowboy, co-starring Debra Winger. [PAR] During the 1980s, Travolta starred in a string of mediocre movies, including Staying Alive (1983), a sequel to Saturday Night Fever that was directed and co-written by Sylvester Stallone, Two of a Kind (1983), a romantic comedy that reteamed the actor with Newton-John, and Perfect (1985), about the health-club scene in Los Angeles. In 1994, Travolta staged a comeback when he appeared as the pony-tailed hitman Vincent Vega in writer-director Quentin Tarantino\u2019s crime drama Pulp Fiction. The film, which included a now-famous scene in which Travolta\u2019s character enters a dance contest and does the twist with his boss\u2019s wife (played by Uma Thurman) earned Travolta his second Best Actor Oscar nomination and put him back on Hollywood\u2019s A-list. Following Pulp Fiction, Travolta starred in such movies as Get Shorty (1995), Face/Off (1997), Primary Colors (1998), A Civil Action (1998), Swordfish (2001) and the movie musical Hairspray (2007), in which he dressed in drag to play Edna Turnblad.

How long does it take for the light from the sun to reach the Earth, and other planets in the Milky Way? How far does the sun's light travel beyond our solar system? How much larger is the sun compared to the planets in our solar system? Thank you for your time. [PAR] The sun's light takes about 8 minutes to reach the Earth after it has been emitted from the sun's surface. The time it takes for light to reach planets in our Solar System (not the Milky Way, which is our galaxy) varies from about 3 minutes for Mercury, to about 5.3 hours for Pluto. There is nothing out in space to prevent the sun's light from going infinitely far, in principle. In practice, the sun is only 4.5 billion years old, so its light can only extend 4.5 billion light years away from us right now. But there's nothing to stop that light from expanding outwards forever, as time goes on. The sun's radius is about 100 times that of the Earth, meaning that about 1.12 million Earths could fit inside it, as could about 930 Jupiter's.

[PAR] Did you know though that the light that is currently reaching Earth was generated in the core of the Sun 100,000 years ago? Pretty amazing! [PAR] The intense pressure at the core of the sun causes atoms of hydrogen to fuse and become helium emitting light. The individual particles of light take thousands of years to gradually work their way to the sun\u2019s surface, as they keep being absorbed and re-emitted in random directions, and at slightly lower levels of energy. Once they finally do reach the surface, the light particles zoom away at 300000 km/sec, reaching Earth in about 8 minutes and 26 seconds.[DOC] [TLE] SunThe Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System.

[PAR] They originated on the planet of Mondas , which was at one time the tenth planet in our solar system .  It was described as being a twin planet of Earth .  At this point they were not androids.  Instead they were humans , or at least very similar to humans.  For some reason Mondas gradually moved further away from the sun , and eventually became free of the solar system millenia ago.  Because of this relocation, the planet became colder and colder, and the inhabitants had to resort to desparate measures in order to survive .  They perfected the art of cybernetics , and began replacing parts of their bodies with robotics .  At first they only did this with their limbs , but eventually they moved to their organs , nervous system , and eventually even their brains .  In the end they had completely eliminated any of their original biological components.  Unfortunately this included such things as emotions .  Survival became their only goal, and relentless logic their only way of thinking. [PAR] They've threatened the human race several times.  They wish to capture humans and convert them into cybermen, and they want to exploit the Earth for its natural resources .  Fortunately the Doctor has thwarted them at every turn.  In their first encounter with the Doctor (in the episode The Tenth Planet ), not only did they not succeed in conquering the Earth, but they managed to get Mondas blown up in the process.  They relocated to a planet called Telos after they lost their home world.  The natives of Telos, the Cryons , were not happy about this.  For some reason the cybermen constructed a tomb for themselves there, but it wasn't a normal sort of tomb, because people were able to awaken them and bring them back into action. [PAR] Cybermen are humanoid , but would not be mistaken for a human being .  They are silver or grey , and have definite robotic features.  Over the years, their appearance changed.  In their early episodes , they looked a bit like humans wearing silver cloth, with a few other robotic features added.  Later on they looked more like \"real\" androids. [PAR] The cybermen are extremely strong , but they do not move very quickly.  Watching them cross any sort of distance is quite painful.  Their primary weakness is gold .  Particularly gold dust .  When it is put in their chest plates, it is fatal.  A weapon called the glitter gun was sometimes used to launch the gold dust into their chest plates. [PAR] The cybermen are usually led by a cyberman called the Cybercontroller .  Usually the Cybercontroller is larger than the other cybermen, and may have slightly different coloring to indicate rank . [PAR] The cybermats were small, mechanical creatures used by the cybermen.  They were grey or silver, and looked a little like rodents or like crustaceans .  They were about the size of a rat .  They have been known to inject poison , fire lasers , and make use of some sort of telepathy , depending on the episode.

In this article, we look at some of the most famous fictional British schools and see how they compare with the real-life boarding school experience. [PAR] 1. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry [PAR] Harry Potter has reignited interest in boarding school fiction. [PAR] The most recent and arguably most famous example of a fictional boarding school is Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, attended by Harry Potter and his friends (and foes). Though it\u2019s clearly not based on a particular real-life boarding school, it\u2019s closely modelled on the concept of a British boarding school, and we see many parallels with them \u2013 which don\u2019t include the moving staircases, enchanted ceilings and talking paintings! Hogwarts is divided up into \u2018houses\u2019 \u2013 Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin. These houses form four distinct communities, and provide a social hub for their members, as there are common rooms for each house, and this is also where students\u2019 dormitories are located. This system is also true of real-life boarding schools, which also get divided into houses; though real-life boarding school pupils aren\u2019t sorted into their houses using a Sorting Hat! Another similarity is the uniforms; though real-life schools don\u2019t make their pupils wear robes (though that of Christ\u2019s Hospital comes close), the colour scheme of those depicted in the films is surprisingly similar to real-life schools. And just like real-life boarders, pupils at Hogwarts are allowed to go on organised outings \u2013 in their case to the nearby village of Hogsmeade \u2013 with parental permission, of course. [PAR] 2. Malory Towers [PAR] Created by Enid Blyton \u2013 the author responsible for such classics as the Famous Five and Secret Seven novels, not to mention the children\u2019s character Noddy \u2013 Malory Towers is a fictional girls\u2019 boarding school located by the sea in Cornwall. It looks like a castle, with four round towers named after points of the compass (North, South, East, West) around a central courtyard. There\u2019s even a seawater swimming pool out on the rocks. The plot of the six novels centres on the main character, Darrell Williams, and her efforts to succeed in spite of her fiery temper and the bad influence of her friend Alicia, who encourages her to participate in mischief and pranks. Though the school isn\u2019t thought to be based on any real-life boarding school, at the end of the series the protagonist is heading for a place at the real-life St Andrew\u2019s University, a reflection of the fact that boarding schools tend to offer extremely good preparation for life at the country\u2019s top universities. [PAR] 3. St Trinian\u2019s [PAR] Ronald Searle was also the illustrator of the Molesworth series, about a schoolboy at the fictional St Custard\u2019s prep school. Film still from\u00a0St Trinian\u2019s\u00a0(B. Thompson and O. Parker, 2007) [PAR] St Trinian\u2019s is a girls\u2019 boarding school dreamt up by the cartoonist Ronald Searle. It started life as a cartoon series and was later adapted into a number of very popular films. The twist with St Trinian\u2019s is that it\u2019s populated by girls who are essentially juvenile delinquents, presided over by disreputable teachers. Vice and mayhem rule the day at St Trinian\u2019s; its team sports particularly violent, and murder is by no means unheard of. Though clearly a work of fiction, Searle was inspired to create St Trinian\u2019s by two real-life independent schools: Perse School for Girls, and St Mary\u2019s School, both in the cartoonist\u2019s hometown of Cambridge and the latter a boarding school. It\u2019s also said that the uniforms were inspired by those of his daughter\u2019s school, James Alleyn\u2019s Girls\u2019 School in Dulwich.

[PAR] The band was formed in 1978 by Kevin Rowland and Kevin Archer and took its name from a drug called Dexedrine, a brand of dextroamphetamine (try saying that three times fast) which gave you a massive boost of energy that allowed you to dance all night (where the Midnight Runners part of the name came from). [PAR] Dexys had a unique fashion style, which is often referred to as being taken from Romany Gypsies. \u00c2\u00a0Red spotted neckerchiefs and denim dungarees with no shirt underneath were the order of the day, which coupled with the unruly mop of hair sported by Rowland made the band look, dare I say it, a little tramp like. [PAR] The bands first song was released in 1979 and was called Dance Stance. \u00c2\u00a0It only managed to reach number 40 in the UK charts but their next song, Geno, shot to number one when it came out in April 1980. \u00c2\u00a0The song was a homage to Geno Washington, an American R&B singer. [PAR] Not happy with their share of the records profits, the band cunningly stole the master tapes to their first album, Searching for the Young Soul Rebels, in order to negotatiate a better deal. \u00c2\u00a0This paid off as the album performed well and the bands next single There, There, My Dear was also a hit. \u00c2\u00a0At this point Rowland insisted on releasing a song entitled Keep It Part Two (Inferiority Part One) as their next release. \u00c2\u00a0The song bombed and this led to many of the band members departing, citing differences with Rowland as their reason for leaving. [PAR] Undeterred Rowland sought new band members, bringing on board violin players Helen O\u2019Hara, Steve Brennan and Roger MacDuff, who were together referred to as \u201cThe Emerald Express\u201d. \u00c2\u00a0The band took on a more celtic influence with the new members, which led to the catchy Too-Rye-Ay and ultimately second UK number one Come On Eileen, probably the song most people will remember the band for. \u00c2\u00a0The latter song also hit the top of the charts in the US, but this was the bands only real success in America, and so they are often thought of as a one-hit wonder over there. [PAR] Dexys enjoyed further success with a cover of a Van Morrison song, Jackie Wilson Said (I\u2019m In Heaven When You Smile). \u00c2\u00a0Must admit I never realised the song title had the bracketed part to it! \u00c2\u00a0The song was of course a homage to another US R&B singer, Jackie Wilson, inspired by a line from his song Reet Petite. \u00c2\u00a0However, when Dexys Midnight Runners performed it on Top of the Pops some wag decided it would be a good idea to project a picture of Scottish Darts playing Legend Jocky Wilson on a screen behind the band instead. \u00c2\u00a0Opinion is split on whether this was deliberate or a mistake (I\u2019m guessing it was more on the deliberate side) but its one of those facts that you simply don\u2019t believe until you see it for yourself. \u00c2\u00a0If you don\u2019t believe me, then check out the clip at the bottom of this post. [PAR] Before I finish though, there is one more Dexys hit that deserves a mention. \u00c2\u00a0This is Because Of You, a slightly softer song for the band which was used as the theme tune to the 1986 BBC sitcom Brush Strokes that starred Karl Howman as Jacko, a lady\u2019s man house painter. \u00c2\u00a0This was the bands final hit before they disbanded, although the band has reformed a number of times including for a UK tour in 2003.[DOC] [TLE] Dexys Midnight RunnersDexys Midnight Runners (currently called Dexys)\n\n\n### Answer:\njocky wilson </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

The company has brewing facilities in Albany, Georgia; Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin; Eden, North Carolina; Fort Worth, Texas; Irwindale, California; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Trenton, Ohio. On 1 July 2008, Miller formed MillerCoors, a joint venture with rival Molson Coors to consolidate the production and distribution of its products in the United States, with each parent company's corporate operations and international operations remaining separate and independent of the joint venture. The stock ticker symbol is SAB.L. [PAR] History [PAR] Miller Brewing Company was founded in 1855 by Frederick Miller when he purchased the small Plank Road Brewery. The brewery's location in the Miller Valley in Milwaukee provided easy access to raw materials produced on nearby farms. The company remained in the family until 1966. [PAR] In 1966, the conglomerate W. R. Grace and Company bought Miller from Mrs. Lorraine John Mulberger (Frederick Miller's granddaughter, who objected to alcohol) and her family. In 1969, Philip Morris (now Altria) bought Miller from W.R. Grace for $130 million, outbidding PepsiCo. In 2002, South African Breweries bought Miller from Philip Morris for $3.6 billion worth of stock and $2 billion in debt to form SABMiller, with Philip Morris retaining a 36% ownership share and 24.99% voting rights. [PAR] In 2006, Miller Brewing purchased Sparks and Steel Reserve brands from McKenzie River Corporation for $215 million cash.  Miller had been producing both brands prior to this purchase. [PAR] In 2007, SABMiller and Molson Coors combined their U.S. operations in a joint venture called MillerCoors. SABMiller owns 58% of the unit, which operates in the United States but not in Canada, where Molson Coors is strongest. Molson Coors owns the rest of the joint venture, but the companies have equal voting power.  [PAR] Current brands [PAR] Miller beers [PAR] *Miller Lite: A pilsner type light beer. It is 4.2% ABV (4% in Canada). [PAR] *Miller Genuine Draft: Nicknamed MGD. Introduced in 1985 with the claim of tasting like draft beer, based on the fact that the beer is cold filtered and not pasteurized. MGD received the gold medal in the American-style Premium Lager category at the 1999 World Beer Cup. It also received the silver medal at the 2003 Great American Beer Festival. The concept for cold-filtered Miller Genuine Draft was developed by product consultant Calle & Company. Martin Calle evolved the concept from Miller's New Ventures effort to launch a new dry beer at a time Miller Brewing was in danger of becoming a much-cloned light beer manufacturer. Originally introduced as \"Miller High Life Genuine Draft\", the \"High Life\" part of the name was soon dropped. MGD is actually made from the same recipe as Miller High Life but with a different treatment. It was developed to try and replicate the non-pasteurized keg flavor of High Life  in a can or bottle. As of 2007 Genuine Draft had a 1.5% share of the United States market; by 2012 it had declined to 0.7% market share, representing a decline of 1.7 million barrels. It has 4.7% abv.

But the real intention of the gods was to punish mankind, because Prometheus had given them the fire stolen from Olympus, so the box they gave Pandora was full of evil and plagues. Out of curiosity, she opened the lid, and evil invaded the world. Desperate, she managed to close the lid again, but only Hope was left inside the box. [PAR] 8 Pins4 Followers[DOC] [TLE] Pandora's Box - Greek Gods and GoddessesPandora's Box [PAR] [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site [PAR] Pandora's Box [PAR] Pandora's box was a poisonous gift given by gods to mankind... but let's start with the beginning. [PAR] Zeus was terribly mad when the titan Prometheus stole the fire from the gods and gave it to man. That's why he decided to punish all mankind (which, until then, had lived in a state of perpetual bliss and innocence, the Golden Age). He asked Hephaistos to make the woman, out of clay. Until then, there were no women on earth. Hephaistos made her taking as a model the beautiful goddesses, and each god gave her a quality: beauty, grace, manual dexterity, boldness, persuasion, curiosity, cunning and deceit (well, these are not exactly qualities). She was given the name Pandora (all-gifted). Then the gods gave her a mysterious box (or jar), as a wedding gift, and told her not to open it. [PAR] Pandora, 1869 [PAR] Buy this Giclee Print at AllPosters.com [PAR] Prometheus , who could tell the future, refused to accept the woman. He also warned his brother, Epimetheus, about turning down Zeus' gifts. But when Epimetheus saw Pandora, he instantly fell in love with her and married her. [PAR] At that time, the proverb \"curiosity killed the cat\" didn't exist yet. So what would a woman do, as soon as you told her not to do something? She'd do it, of course. So Pandora opened the box (or the jar, whatever it was), which contained, instead of real gifts, just evil and plagues. All of them flew out of Pandora's box and spread into the world: crime, poverty, pain, hunger, sickness, vice. They al looked like small, winged creatures. [PAR] Buy This at Allposters.com [PAR] Terrified, Pandora closed the lid. But the gods, feeling a little sorry for what they were about to do, had put, among the evil creatures, a good one whose task was to heal the wounds of the body and soul. This wonderful creature was Hope. When Pandora's box was opened again, Hope managed to fly away and to go around the world and heal the wounds produced by the plagues. But, as she escaped much later, she is always the last one to arrive. That's why, when people are harassed by problems, the only thing that helps them go ahead is hope. [PAR] There is also another version about Pandora's box: the gods filled it with good things, as a wedding gift for Epimetheus, and told Pandora not to open it. When she disobeyed, all the good things flew back to the Olympus, so there was left nothing good for the mankind. With one exception: Hope, as Pandora managed to put the lid back before Hope flew away (in this case, the gift was really a gift, but we shouldn't forget the gods wanted to punish mankind. You've got it, right? The punishment was *the woman*. Ouch! I protest!) [PAR] Pandora and Epimetheus had a daughter, Pyrrha.

Shortly before recording their debut single, the Beatles dismissed drummer Pete Best. [PAR] Two months earlier, the group passed an audition for Parlophone Records. But while producer George Martin liked what he heard, he was dissatisfied with Best. He told the Beatles that, while they could use Best onstage, he was going to bring in a session drummer for the recordings. The other Beatles, along with manager Brian Epstein, discussed the situation and decided that it was in their best interests to sack the drummer entirely. On Aug. 16, Epstein called Best into his office and told him the news that he was out. [PAR] Known around Liverpool as \u201cmean, moody and magnificent,\u201d\u00a0Best had joined the Beatles almost exactly two years earlier when they needed a drummer for their upcoming residency in Hamburg, Germany. His audition was only a few days before they made the\u00a0trip. But his sullen personality never fit in well with the wisecracking Beatles, even refusing to adopt the soon-to-be-famous \u201cBeatles haircut.\u201d [PAR] Best was the most popular Beatle with their female fan base and long maintained that he was fired because they were jealous of his looks. But when five songs from the Beatles\u2019 Decca audition were officially released on the 1995 Anthology set, it proved that Best\u2019s drumming \u2014 both in terms of his timekeeping and inventiveness \u2014 was inferior to his replacement\u2019s.

He had one brother, Pierre-Antoine . Cousteau completed his preparatory studies at the Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas in Paris. In 1930, he entered the \u00c9cole Navale and graduated as a gunnery officer. After an automobile accident cut short his career in naval aviation, Cousteau indulged his interest in the sea. [PAR] In Toulon, where he was serving on the Condorcet, Cousteau carried out his first underwater experiments, thanks to his friend Philippe Tailliez who in 1936 lent him some Fernez underwater goggles , predecessors of modern swimming goggles . [1] Cousteau also belonged to the information service of the French Navy , and was sent on missions to Shanghai and Japan (1935\u20131938) and in the USSR (1939).[ citation needed ] [PAR] On 12 July 1937 he married Simone Melchior , with whom he had two sons, Jean-Michel (born 1938) and Philippe (1940\u20131979). His sons took part in the adventures of the Calypso . In 1991, one year after his wife Simone's death from cancer, he married Francine Triplet . They already had a daughter Diane Cousteau (born 1980) and a son Pierre-Yves Cousteau (born 1982), born during Cousteau's marriage to his first wife. [PAR] Early 1940s: Innovation of modern underwater diving [PAR] Edit [PAR] The years of World War II were decisive for the history of diving. After the armistice of 1940 , the family of Simone and Jacques-Yves Cousteau took refuge in Meg\u00e8ve , where he became a friend of the Ichac family who also lived there. Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Marcel Ichac shared the same desire to reveal to the general public unknown and inaccessible places\u00a0\u2014 for Cousteau the underwater world and for Ichac the high mountains. The two neighbors took the first ex-aequo prize of the Congress of Documentary Film in 1943, for the first French underwater film: Par dix-huit m\u00e8tres de fond (18 meters deep), made without breathing apparatus the previous year in the Embiez islands ( Var ) with Philippe Tailliez and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dumas , using a depth-pressure-proof camera case developed by mechanical engineer L\u00e9on V\u00e8che (engineer of Arts and M\u00e9tiers and the Naval College). [PAR] In 1943, they made the film \u00c9paves (Shipwrecks), in which they used two of the very first Aqua-Lung prototypes. These prototypes were made in Boulogne-Billancourt by the Air Liquide company, following instructions from Cousteau and \u00c9mile Gagnan . [2] When making \u00c9paves, Cousteau could not find the necessary blank reels of movie film, but had to buy hundreds of small still camera film reels the same width, intended for a make of child's camera, and cemented them together to make long reels. [3] [4] [PAR] Having kept bonds with the English speakers (he spent part of his childhood in the United States and usually spoke English) and with French soldiers in North Africa (under Admiral Lemonnier ), Jacques-Yves Cousteau (whose villa \"Baobab\" at Sanary ( Var ) was opposite Admiral Darlan 's villa \"Reine\"), helped the French Navy to join again with the Allies; he assembled a commando operation against the Italian espionage services in France, and received several military decorations for his deeds. At that time, he kept his distance from his brother Pierre-Antoine Cousteau , a \"pen anti-semite\" who wrote the collaborationist newspaper Je suis partout (I am everywhere) and who received the death sentence in 1946. However, this was later commuted to a life sentence, and Pierre-Antoine was released in 1954. [PAR] During the 1940s, Cousteau is credited with improving the aqua-lung design which gave birth to the open-circuit scuba technology used today. According to his first book, The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure (1953), Cousteau started diving with Fernez goggles in 1936, and in 1939 used the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus invented in 1926 by\n\n\n### Answer:\ncalypso </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] Answer: The US Constitution lists three requirements for any individual wishing to become president of the United States . A president must: [PAR] be a natural born U.S. citizen. Someone may be born abroad, but only if both parents were citizens of the United States. The only exception to this was for those around at the time the Constitution was adopted. Their requirement was that they had to be a citizen when the Constitution was adopted. [PAR] be at least 35 years of age. The youngest president elected was 43 years old. However, there was one president who was even younger. Do you know who he was? [PAR] have lived in the United States for at least 14 years to be president. This does not have to be consecutive or even the 14 years leading up to becoming president. [PAR] Obviously, a lot more is needed than this. The candidate must be acceptable to a large number of people across the nation. Nonetheless, these are the minimum constitutional requirements for someone to become president of the United States.[DOC] [TLE] Requirements to Become President of the United StatesRequirements to Become President of the United States [PAR] By\u00a0 Phaedra Trethan [PAR] Updated June 14, 2016. [PAR] What are the constitutional requirements to serve as President of the United States? Forget the nerves of steel, the charisma, the skeleton-free closet, the fund-raising network, the thick skin and the legions of loyal folks who agree with your stance on all the issues. Just to get into the game, you have to ask: How old are you and where were you born? [PAR] Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution imposes only three eligibility requirements on persons serving as president \u2013 based on the officeholder\u2019s age, time of residency in the U.S., and citizenship status. Under the Twelfth Amendment , the same three qualifications apply to the Vice President of the United States . [PAR] Only \"natural-born\" U.S. citizens (or those born abroad, but only to parents at least one of whom was a U.S. citizen at the time) may serve president of the United States , though from time to time that requirement is called into question, recently in the case of potential 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R - Texas), who was born in Canada to Cuban-born father and a U.S-born mother. [PAR] One must also be at least 35 years of age to be president. John F. Kennedy was the youngest person to be elected president; he was 43 years old when he was inaugurated in 1961. There is no maximum age limit set forth in the Constitution. Ronald Reagan was the oldest president ; at the end of his term in 1988, he was nearly 77. [PAR] Finally, one must have lived in the United States for at least 14 years to be president, in addition to being a natural-born citizen. The Constitution is vague on this point. For example, it does not make clear whether those 14 years need to be consecutive or what the precise definition of residency is. So far, however, this requirement has never been challenged. [PAR] These are the only explicit criteria in the Constitution. [PAR] Further Discussion [PAR] Age [PAR] In setting the minimum age for serving as president at 35 \u2013 compared to 30 for senators and 25 for representatives \u2013 the Framers of the Constitution implemented their belief that the person holding the nation\u2019s highest elected office should be a person of maturity and experience. Remember that in the 1780s, people in their 30s were considered to be middle-aged. As early Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story once noted, the \"character and talent\" of a middle aged person is \"fully developed,\" allowing them a greater opportunity to have experienced \u201cpublic service\u201d and to have served \u201cin the public councils.\u201d [PAR] US Residency [PAR] While a Member of Congress need only be an \u201cinhabitant\u201d of the state he or she represents, the president must have been a \u201cresident\u201d of the U.S. for at least 14 years.

J. Mitchell's 1931 design to meet Air Ministry specification F7/30 for a new and modern fighter capable of 251 mph (404 km/h), the Supermarine Type 224, resulted in an open-cockpit monoplane with bulky gull-wings and a large fixed, spatted undercarriage powered by the evaporative-cooled Rolls-Royce Goshawk engine. This made its first flight in February 1934. The aircraft was a big disappointment to Mitchell and his design team, who immediately embarked on a series of \"cleaned-up\" designs, using their experience with the Schneider Trophy seaplanes as a starting point. Mitchell had already begun working on a new aircraft, designated Type 300, based on the Type 224. With a retractable gear with the wingspan reduced, the aircraft was submitted to the Air Ministry in July 1934, but again was not accepted. The design evolved through a number of changes, including an enclosed cockpit, oxygen-breathing apparatus, even smaller and thinner wings, and the newly-developed, more powerful Rolls-Royce PV-XII V-12 engine, later named the Merlin. In November 1934, Mitchell, with the backing of Supermarine's owner, Vickers-Armstrong's, started detailed design work on the Type 300. The Air Ministry issued a contract AM 361140/34 on 1st December 1934. On 3rd January 1935, the Air Ministry formalised the contract and a new Specification F10/35 was written around the aircraft. [PAR] On 5th March 1936 the prototype (K5054) took off on its first flight from Eastleigh Aerodrome. This eight minute flight came four months after the maiden flight of the contemporary Hawker Hurricane. [PAR] The British public first saw the Spitfire at the RAF Hendon air-display on Saturday 27th June 1936. Although full-scale production was supposed to begin immediately, there were numerous problems which could not be overcome for some time and the first production Spitfire, did not roll off the Woolston, Southampton assembly line until mid-1938. The first and most immediate problem was that the main Supermarine factory at Woolston was already working at full capacity fulfilling orders for Walruses and Stranraers. Although outside contractors were supposed to be involved in manufacturing many important Spitfire components, especially the wings, Vickers-Armstrong's (the parent company) were reluctant to see the Spitfire being manufactured by outside concerns and were slow to release the necessary blueprints and sub-components. As a result of the delays in getting the Spitfire into full production, the Air Ministry put forward a plan that production of the Spitfire be stopped after the initial order for 310, after which Supermarine would build Bristol Beaufighter's. The managements of Supermarine and Vickers were able to persuade the Air Ministry that the problems could be overcome and further orders were placed for 200 Spitfires on 24th March 1938, the two orders covering the K, L and N prefix serial numbers. [PAR] By May 1940, Castle Bromwich had not yet built its first Spitfire, in spite of promises that the factory would be producing 60 per week starting in April. On 17th May Lord Beaverbrook, Minister of Aircraft Production, telephoned Lord Nuffield and manoeuvred him into handing over control of the Castle Bromwich plant to Beaverbrook's Ministry. Beaverbrook immediately sent in experienced management staff and experienced workers from Supermarine and gave over control of the factory to Vickers-Armstrong. Although it would take some time to resolve the problems, in June 1940, 10 Mk II's were built; in July, 23 rolled out, 37 in August, and 56 in September. These were the first of thousands of Spitfires to emerge from Castle Bromwich. By the time production ended at Castle Bromwich in June 1945, a total of 12,129 Spitfires (921 Mk II's, 4,489 Mk Vs, 5,665 Mk IX's, and 1,054 Mk XVI's) had been built. [PAR] During the Battle of Britain, concerted efforts were made by the Luftwaffe to destroy the main manufacturing plants at Woolston and Itchen, near Southampton.

At first it was a song on their 1967 album Days of Future Passed, the first to feature new members Justin Hayward, who wrote the song, and John Lodge. The melody of this ballad, as has been noted elsewhere, is close to the one used by Ben E. King on his 1963 melodramatic soul hit \"I (Who Have Nothing).\" That melody itself had been based on an Italian song King had heard in Italy, with English lyrics by his producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Still, the instrumentation on the Moody Blues track is substantially different, particularly in the use of an eerie mellotron, an instrument of course that would be a staple of the group's most popular recordings. \"Nights in White Satin\" does effectively fulfill what was probably the purpose Hayward and his bandmates had in mind for it: a ghostly, haunting nocturnal ballad, with a lilting and memorable melody. The melodrama gets pushed to the fore (as does the resemblance to the chorus of \"I (Who Have Nothing)\") on the chorus, as the tempo becomes more emphatic and the group's background vocals become especially eerie, like voices in a windblown night. The instrumental break is also well done and in keeping with the hushed mood of the production, an echoed drumbeat leading into a lonely flute solo, the orchestration becoming more dense as the break progresses, building to a near-crescendo before leading into the final verse. It wasn't until 1972, though, that the song became a huge American hit, when it was pulled out for a single. It was, in fact, a Top 20 hit no less than three times in Britain: first just after the release of Days of Future Passed, then again in late 1972, and then again in late 1979. If you're looking for a peculiar big-name cover version of \"Nights in White Satin,\" check out the one War did in the early '70s, when Eric Burdon was still their leader and lead singer.

[PAR] Background and family life [PAR] Blair was born at the Queen Mary Maternity Home in Edinburgh , Scotland on 6 May 1953 , the second son of Leo and Hazel Blair (n\u00e9e Corscadden). Leo Blair, the illegitimate  son of two English actors, had been adopted by a Glasgow shipyard worker named James Blair and his wife Mary as a baby. Hazel Corscadden was the daughter of George Corscadden, a butcher and Orangeman who had moved to Glasgow in 1916 but returned to (and died in) Ballyshannon in 1923, where his wife Sarah Margaret ne\u00e9 Lipsett gave birth to Blair's mother Hazel above her family's grocery shop. The Lipsett family in Donegal supposedly originated with a German Jewish immigrant to Ireland prior to the 18th century . George Corscadden was from a family of Protestant farmers in County Donegal, Ireland , who descended from Scottish settlers that took their family name from Garscadden, now part of Glasgow . The Blair family was often taken on holiday to Rossnowlagh, a beach resort near Hazel's hometown of Ballyshannon which is the venue of the main Orange order parade in the Republic of Ireland . Tony Blair has one elder brother, William Blair, who is a barrister and Queen's Counsel (QC), and a younger sister, Sarah. Blair spent the first 19 months of his life at the family home in Paisley Terrace in the Willowbrae area of Edinburgh. During this period his father worked as a junior tax inspector whilst also studying for a law degree from the University of Edinburgh. His family spent three and a half years in the 1950s living in Adelaide , Australia , where his father was a lecturer in law at the University of Adelaide. The Blairs lived close to the university, in the suburb of Dulwich. [PAR] The family returned to Britain in the late 1950s, living for a time with Hazel Blair's stepfather William McClay and her mother at their home in Stepps, near Glasgow. He spent the remainder of his childhood in Durham , England , his father being by then a lecturer at Durham University. After attending Durham's Chorister School from 1961 to 1966, Blair boarded at Fettes College, a notable independent school in Edinburgh, where he met Charlie Falconer (a pupil at the rival Edinburgh Academy), whom he later appointed Lord Chancellor. He reportedly modelled himself on Mick Jagger. His teachers were unimpressed with him: his biographer, John Rentoul reported that, \"All the teachers I spoke to when researching the book said he was a complete pain in the backside, and they were very glad to see the back of him\".

With wondrous art, he creates a beautiful statue more perfect than any living woman. The more he looks upon her, the more deeply he falls in love with her, until he wishes that she were more than a statue. This statue is Galatea. Lovesick, Pygmalion goes to the temple of the goddess Venus and prays that she give him a lover like his statue; Venus is touched by his love and brings Galatea to life. When Pygmalion returns from Venus' temple and kisses his statue, he is delighted to find that she is warm and soft to the touch--\"The maiden felt the kisses, blushed and, lifting her timid eyes up to the light, saw the sky and her lover at the same time\" (Frank Justus Miller, trans.). [PAR] Myths such as this are fine enough when studied through the lens of centuries and the buffer of translations and editions, but what happens when one tries to translate such an allegory into Victorian England? That is just what George Bernard Shaw does in his version of the Pygmalion myth. In doing so, he exposes the inadequacy of myth and of romance in several ways. For one, he deliberately twists the myth so that the play does not conclude as euphorically or conveniently, hanging instead in unconventional ambiguity. Next, he mires the story in the sordid and mundane whenever he gets a chance. Wherever he can, the characters are seen to be belabored by the trivial details of life like napkins and neckties, and of how one is going to find a taxi on a rainy night. These noisome details keep the story grounded and decidedly less romantic. Finally, and most significantly, Shaw challenges the possibly insidious assumptions that come with the Pygmalion myth, forcing us to ask the following: Is the male artist the absolute and perfect being who has the power to create woman in the image of his desires? Is the woman necessarily the inferior subject who sees her lover as her sky? Can there only ever be sexual/romantic relations between a man and a woman? Does beauty reflect virtue? Does the artist love his creation, or merely the art that brought that creation into being? [PAR] Famous for writing \"talky\" plays in which barely anything other than witty repartee takes center stage (plays that the most prominent critics of his day called non-plays), Shaw finds in Pygmalion a way to turn the talk into action, by hinging the fairy tale outcome of the flower girl on precisely how she talks. In this way, he draws our attention to his own art, and to his ability to create, through the medium of speech, not only Pygmalion's Galatea, but Pygmalion himself. More powerful than Pygmalion, on top of building up his creations, Shaw can take them down as well by showing their faults and foibles. In this way, it is the playwright alone, and not some divine will, who breathes life into his characters. While Ovid's Pygmalion may be said to have idolized his Galatea, Shaw's relentless and humorous honesty humanizes these archetypes, and in the process brings drama and art itself to a more contemporarily relevant and human level.

It is produced by the Met Office and broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The forecasts sent over the Navtex system use a similar format and the same sea areas. The waters around the British Isles are divided into 31 sea areas, also known as weather areas (see map below)  There are four broadcasts per day at the following (UK local) times: [PAR] * 0048 \u2013 transmitted on FM and LW. Includes weather reports from an extended list of coastal stations at 0052 and an inshore waters forecast at 0055 and concludes with a brief UK weather outlook for the coming day.

[PAR] The unique and distinctive sound of these broadcasts has led to their attracting an audience much wider than that directly interested in maritime weather conditions. Many listeners find the repetition of the names of the sea areas almost hypnotic, particularly during the night-time broadcast at 0048 UK time. [PAR] History [PAR] In October 1859, the steam clipper Royal Charter was wrecked in a strong storm off Anglesey; 450\u00a0people lost their lives. Due to this loss, Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy introduced a warning service for shipping in February 1861, using telegraph communications. This remained the United Kingdom's Met Office primary responsibility for some time afterwards. In 1911, the Met Office began issuing marine weather forecasts which included gale and storm warnings via radio transmission for areas around Great Britain. This service was discontinued during and following the First World War, between 1914 and June 1921, and again during the Second World War between 1939 and 1945.  [PAR] Today, although most ships have onboard technology to provide the Forecast's information, they still use it to check their data. [PAR] On Friday 30 May 2014, for the first time in more than 90 years, the BBC failed to broadcast the Shipping Forecast at 5:20 am. Staff at Broadcasting House were reading out the report but it was not transmitted. Listeners instead heard BBC World Service.

Later modifications include the introduction of Fisher in 1955, when Dogger was split in two. Heligoland was renamed German Bight a year later. Around 1983, the Minches sea area was merged with Hebrides. In 1984, the areas in the North Sea were coordinated with those of neighbouring countries, introducing North Utsire and South Utsire and reducing Viking in size. Finisterre was renamed FitzRoy in 2002, to avoid confusion with the (smaller) sea area of the same name used in the marine forecasts produced by the French and Spanish meteorological offices.  Some names still differ; for example, the Dutch KNMI names the area equivalent to Forties after the Fladen bank, while M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France calls the English Channel sea areas Dover, Wight, Portland, and Plymouth respectively Pas de Calais, Antifer, Casquets, and Ouessant.

The focal point of the painting is the reflective pearl earring.  The painting was first called Girl with a Turban but was renamed in the second part of the twentieth century.  Some believe the real focal point of the painting is the way the girls\u2019 eyes interact with the person viewing the painting. [PAR] Vermeer had never have identified any sitter posing for any of his portraits and that includes the young woman who posed for the Girl with a Pearl Earring painting.  Some art critics have stated that the girl may have been one of Vermeer\u2019s daughters named Maria.  Maria would be approximately 12 or 13 years old at the time Vermeer created his masterpiece, Girl with a Pearl Earring.  Several of Vermeer\u2019s paintings have similar facial features to the Girl with a Pearl Earring, but due to the different poses and lighting in the various paintings comparisons are difficult to establish. [PAR] Girl with a Pearl Earring is located in the Mauritshuis gallery in The Hague.  Some have called this painting the Mona Lisa of the North and some have called it the Dutch Mona Lisa.  The signature on the painting is signed \u201cIVMeer\u201d and it is does not have a date on it.  This painting is the best-loved painting by Vermeer possibly because of the way the girl is looking over her shoulder, which draws the attention from the viewer, giving a feeling her head turns to see the viewer.  The women in Vermeer\u2019s paintings were usually depicted in a deep thought-provoking poses that speaks to the uniformity in his subjects. [PAR] The light effects and the highlights on the turban on the girls\u2019 head are a trademark that belongs to Vermeer.  The pearl is made up of no more than two brushstrokes, with the girl gazing with uninhibited, wide eyes, making her appear lost in thought. Girl with a Pearl Earring was painted as oil on canvas that measured 17.5 inches by 15 inches. [PAR] The dark background of the painting helped to create a three-dimensional feeling to the subject of the painting.  This was a Dutch custom used by Vermeer in his some of his paintings. The use of green ochre tone was used by Vermeer as an undercoating in the painting that made colors of the figure more vibrant.  His skill with under painting created this three-dimensional look and the girl\u2019s skin contrasts with the background, creating a glowing effect. [PAR] Vermeer\u2019s use of light was dramatized by the white-based undercoat that intensified the reflective surfaces of the pearl earring as well as the eyes and lips of the girl in the painting.  The girl\u2019s dress is enhanced by the use of the undercoating that gives a realistic impression of the actual material in the painting.  A thin final layer on the painting adds movement to the work as light moves across the painting.

It is one of the only H-B shows that didn't get a series revival (in digital ink and paint) for the 1980s. [PAR] Contents [PAR] Edit [PAR] Originally broadcast on Wednesdays [8:30-9pm Eastern], Top Cat was co-sponsored by Kellogg's and Bristol-Myers ( Bufferin ). [PAR] The central character, Top Cat \u2014 called T.C. by close friends, \"providing it's with dignity\" as the lyrics of the theme song say \u2014 is the leader of a gang of New York City alley cats : Fancy-Fancy, Spook, Benny the Ball, The Brain, and Choo Choo. Top Cat and his gang were inspired by characters from the popular situation comedy The Phil Silvers Show . It has also been said that the Bowery Boys influenced the show. Maurice Gosfield , who played Private Duane Doberman on The Phil Silvers Show, also provided the voice for Benny the Ball in Top Cat (Benny's rotund appearance was based on Gosfield too). Arnold Stang 's voicing of Top Cat strongly resembled Phil Silvers ' voice as well. [2 ] [3 ] [PAR] A frequent plot-line revolved around the local NYPD (although it's never mentioned that Dibble is a New York cop) policeman , Officer Charles \"Charlie\" Dibble, and his ineffective attempts to evict the gang from the alley. The only reason that he wanted to be rid of them was that Top Cat and his gang were constantly attempting to earn a quick dollar\u2014usually through an illegal scam. Dibble's appearance was modeled on Allen Jenkins, who did his voice. The name Dibble has passed into the vernacular as slang for police officers.

Benny may appear to be simple-minded, but he manages to ask the most logical questions during the gang's erratic endeavors. He is slow, not stupid. The gang relationship between Benny and Top Cat is based on a devoted friendship between them. An example of the lengths to which Top Cat will go to help Benny is illustrated by the episode \"A Visit From Mother\" in which Top Cat arranges for Benny to appear to be the mayor of New York City. A number of episodes have focused on Benny, including \"The Violin Player\", \" The Unscratchables \" and \"The Missing Heir\". Benny the Ball is modeled after his voice actor Maurice Gosfield [4 ].

When creating the character, George Miller started with an assumption that 'today's tyrant is yesterday's hero'. Aunty Entity built Bartertown with good intentions, trying to rebuild civilization, bring back trade and give people hope for tomorrow. Unfortunately, according to Miller, in the process she became a tyrant [1] : [PAR] \u201c [PAR] They create a new order, and they love that world too much, then they become what you might-call holdfast.

[PAR] \u201d [PAR] Tina Turner was selected to play the role because she is perceived as a positive persona and to give the sense that Aunty Entity was once a hero which amplifies how tragic that character is. She was selected because Aunty's age was to be indeterminate, to underline the fact she is a survivor with a lot of charisma, capable of building a place like Bartertown and that she represents both good and evil. Aunty's personality reflects Max's in a way that she built a physical world for herself and she will not allow for any evolution or change, much like Max who is incapable of letting go of his past. It was argued by George Miller [2] that, should Max join The Lost Tribe and rebuild civilization in destroyed Sydney - he would become just like Aunty Entity, desperately protecting his world to eventually become a tyrant. Max's connection to his past is internalized however, unlike Aunty Entity's which is represented by Bartertown. Ultimately she recognizes that Max and herself share the same qualities, which is the reason she spares his life at the very end of Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. [PAR] \u201c [PAR] Edit [PAR] Aunty claimed that before the pox-eclipse she was a nobody, but the day after, she had the chance to become a somebody, for she was one that survived. [PAR] She was an Amazon-like woman who ruled with an iron-fist but found herself being challenged by the diminutive Master and his brutish henchman Blaster : Aunty Entity is enraged at this but is unable to publicly oppose the duo of \"Master Blaster\" due to Master being the only one who knows how to work all the machines that keep Bartertown running. [PAR] To this end the scheming Aunty Entity manipulates Mad Max into a gladiatorial battle (known as the \" Thunderdome \") against Blaster with hopes Max will kill him, in effect using Max as a convenient means of exacting political assassination without being caught. [PAR] Max manages to defeat Blaster in combat but refuses to kill him when he realizes after knocking his helmet off, that he suffers from Down Syndrome. Aunty Entity is enraged and has Blaster executed before invoking the harsh ritual of \" bust a deal, face the wheel \" upon Max. Max lands on Gulag, and is exiled from the town to the harsh desert outlands where his chances of survival seem bleak. [PAR] However, Max survives his ordeal and soon finds a group of children living in the wilderness who aid his recovery but wish to find \"Tommorrow-morrow-land\" -- a mythical paradise they believe lies in civilization. Max tells them that they are better off staying away from civilization (Bartertown) but some of the children refuse to listen and head off regardless - Max has little choice but to pursue them. [PAR] Max catches the children in the outskirts of Bartertown and together they go in search of Master, the dwarfish Master has been reduced to little more than a slave by Aunty Entity due to the death of his protector, Blaster. Max and the children free him, however alert the guards in the process and a frantic chase ensues between Aunty Entity's driving elite and Max and the lost children. The disruption in Bartertown's methane factory results in it becoming damaged and exploding.

It is the main cause of cavities and gum disease, and can harden into tartar if not removed daily. [PAR] How Do I Know if I Have Plaque? [PAR] Everyone develops plaque because bacteria are constantly forming in our mouths. These bacteria use ingredients found in our diet and saliva to grow. Plaque causes cavities when the acids from plaque attack teeth after eating. With repeated acid attacks, the tooth enamel can break down and a cavity may form. Plaque that is not removed can also irritate the gums around your teeth, leading to gingivitis (red, swollen, bleeding gums), periodontal disease and tooth loss.

Within this biofilm are bacteria that feed on food particles and sugars in the mouth. The byproduct of this bacterial feeding frenzy are acids that erode tooth enamel and cause cavities. By removing plaque through brushing and flossing, you prevent these acids from eating enamel and help protect the teeth against decay and infection. [PAR] Tartar is the name given to plaque that has hardened. This process begins within hours of plaque forming, but may take up to 48 hours to complete. Once formed, tartar will continue to harden \u2013 holding and protecting all acids and bacteria fast to the teeth \u2013 until it is removed. [PAR] Plaque is easy to remove with brushing and flossing. Tartar, on the other hand, may be impossible to remove at home.

The Eagles served as the primary spacecraft of Moonbase Alpha, which has a fleet of them, and are often used to explore alien planets, defend the Moonbase from attack, and to transport supplies and other items to and from the Moon. The Eagle was designed by Brian Johnson who had worked with Gerry Anderson on Thunderbirds in the mid-60s, which influenced the spaceship designs of Star Wars and other science fiction films in the later years. [PAR] These Eagles must have been constructed by the engineering and technical section of Moonbase Alpha using materials and components either shipped from Earth or manufactured on the Moon itself. It is the only viable explanation for the seemingly endless supply of Eagles despite seeing them frequently crashing or exploding. [PAR] Completely modular, the craft are divided into three basic sections: the command module, the passenger module/service pod, and the superstructure (containing the landing gear, access corridor/galley, aft compartment, fuel tanks and main propulsion system). The command module also has an escape hatch as revealed in the episode \"Devil's Planet\", although it is unknown whether this is an original design feature or an adaptation that was designed by Moonbase Alpha. The command module of the Eagle can detach from the main body as seen in the episode \"Dragon's Domain\" enabling it to dock with another compatible craft or for use as an emergency escape capsule. All Eagles are equipped with artificial gravity. [PAR] The model of the Eagle used in filming was built in four scales: by the end of the series, there were three 44-inch (110 cm) Eagle models, two 22-inch (56 cm) Eagles, one 11-inch (28 cm) Eagle, and a 5-inch (13 cm) Eagle. The superstructure framework was composed of copper tubing on the larger-scale models and the command module was vacuum-formed plastic. Compressed Freon streams were used to portray the vertical jets used in lift-off and landing sequences and, in Year Two, the exhaust from the main rockets. The special effects team worked in Bray Studios, a separate studio away from where the live action filming took place [PAR] Model Kits [PAR] Since 1979 when Airfix first released the Eagle Transporter kit until the re-issue today by Round 2 MPC, all the parts have virtually remained the same with the only difference being the kind of plastic used, and a more comperhensive decal sheet with the latest re-issue. Only the packaging style underwent massive changes thus until today, a lot of work is required to get this kit to look like it's studio model. This entails a lot of drilling, cutting and part replacements. But who is complaining? I for one am really glad Round 2 decided to re-issue her.\n\n\n### Answer:\nspace 1999 </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

This classic is presented as a wonderfully presented edition with a fully interactive table of contents. [PAR] The Prince of Abissinia: A Tale, though often abbreviated to Rasselas, is an apologue about happiness by Samuel Johnson. The book's original working title was \"The Choice of Life\". He wrote the piece in only one week to help pay the costs of his mother's funeral, intending to complete it on 22 January 1759 (the eve of his mother's death). The book was first published in April 1759 in England. Johnson is believed to have received a total of \u00a375 for the copyright. The first American edition followed in 1768. The title page of this edition carried a quotation, inserted by the publisher Robert Bell, from La Rochefoucauld: \"The labour or Exercise of the Body, freeth Man from the Pains of the Mind; and this constitutes the Happiness of the Poor\". [PAR] Johnson was influenced by the vogue for exotic locations. He had translated A Voyage to Abyssinia by Jeronimo Lobo in 1735 and used it as the basis for a \"philosophical romance\". Ten years prior to writing Rasselas he published \"The Vanity of Human Wishes\" in which he describes the inevitable defeat of worldly ambition. Early readers considered Rasselas to be a work of philosophical and practical importance and critics often remark on the difficulty of classifying it as a novel. Johnson was a staunch opponent of slavery, revered by abolitionists, and Rasselas became a name adopted by emancipated slaves.

Dashed out over the course of a single week to pay for his mother\u2019s funeral, Johnson\u2019s only novel was the outcome of a lifetime\u2019s thoughts and experiences. [PAR] A philosophical romance tracing the pilgrimage of an African prince and his companions to Egypt, Rasselas ponders a number of subjects \u2014 romantic love, flights of imagination, the great discoveries of science, and speculations about the meaning of happiness \u2014 all of which, Johnson implies, encourage man with false hopes and unrealistic estimates of what life has to offer. [PAR] Directed specifically against eighteenth-century optimism and, more generally, against all simple formulas for achieving happiness, Rasselas has often been compared with Voltaire\u2019s Candide \u2014 which was published only a few weeks before Johnson\u2019s work. Both novels have deservedly attained the status of classics. [PAR] Reprint of The Prince of Abissinia, Second Edition, R. and J. Dodsley and W. Johnson, London, 1759.

They were made around the same time as the Rings of Power and there were, presumably, many of them since \"In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made\" and there are only twenty Rings of Power, unless twenty is considered \"many\" rings. Gandalf states that though the Elves who forged them thought little of them, he still thinks they are dangerous for mortals. [PAR] They are lesser rings of the Rings of Power , forged by the Elves as \"essays in the craft\"- they bore no gem (similar to the One Ring ). [PAR] History [PAR] Edit [PAR] In the ancient days of the Second Age , before the Fall of N\u00famenor , many rings were forged, the craft being taught by Sauron. These rings aided in the use of spells and magical craft, and thus were widely popular with the Elves. Sauron, then known as \"Lord of the Gifts\" claimed he wished to make Middle-earth as fair as Valinor , and it seemed he convinced the elves to think these rings could do so. [PAR] After the forging of the One Ring, Sauron began drawing these lesser rings to himself. This was not difficult, for the One Ring gave him the strength to subdue the wielders of these powerful artifacts. Once gathered, Sauron could disperse them among his captains, making them all mighty champions whom he could back up at will with his own strength via the magic ring connection. After the Last Alliance of Elves and Men and the First Fall of Sauron, these rings were dispersed through the land. Some were taken from dead warriors, others, borne away by the frightened, still living servants of Sauron, others were lost and little is known of what happened to them until the War of the Ring. [PAR] At the time of the War of the Ring , Sauron gathered again the lesser rings to himself. But this time, he kept a great deal of them so as to advance his own abilities. Though not stated in the books or movies, it seems reasonable to believe that some were given again to his commanders as well, and logically some were lost or destroyed before they could be reclaimed.\u00a0 [PAR] Their ultimate fates are unknown, nor is it known whether or not their powers were bound to the power of the\u00a0 One Ring .\u00a0If they were, then their power would have failed with the destruction of the One. [citation needed] [PAR] Powers [PAR] Edit [PAR] The full extent of the rings' power is unknown, but Gandalf says that \"none are to be used lightly\". They were, to an extent, like the One Ring when it came to temptation. They would give a being strength, magical ability, and the power to dominate other wills. [PAR] It is also believed (though again, not stated) that these rings also had certain fields in which they were strongest. For example, one ring may rule over stone, while another controls ice. This, however, is not known fact, and only stems from what is known about the Rings of Power , assuming that the lesser rings are much like them. [PAR] Also in the 1995-1997 Middle-earth Collectible Card Game several cards describing and depicting lesser rings were released, for example \"The Oracle's Ring\", \"Wizard's Ring\" and \"Magic Rings\" of different power (lore, stealth, courage, etc.).

[PAR] The Crusades were a series of Holy Wars launched by the Christian states of Europe against what were called \"Saracens\". A Saracen was another name used to describe a Muslim during the time of the Crusades. Jerusalem was a city that contained major Holy Sites for both Christians and Muslims, thus the Crusades were mainly a fight over control of the landmark. The Crusades were also a political fight for land and riches. The Crusades is a plural form of \"Crusade\" for the reason that there were a total of nine Crusades, not one. The name \"Crusade\" comes from the French word \"Crois\" meaning \"Cross\". This is due to the fact that European Crusaders placed crosses on their armour after Pope Clermont preached the First Crusade at the Council of Clermont (Year 1095).

The total European forces were about 700,000, with 100,000 being mailed knights. This is because the Crusader movement not only attracted knights, but peasants as well. Peasants were accepted, however they were poorly armed. This attack force ended up taking Jerusalem, slaughtering every Saracen in the city.

And, for just as long as they\u2019ve been around, there have been complaints about them: \u2018Who are the people who comprise the focus groups?\u2019, \u2018Do they have any insider movie knowledge?\u2019, \u2018Why are they more knowledgeable than the screenwriters and directors who have made the film?\u2019, \u201cWhy are studios changing the ending of a movie just because a few random people disliked it?\u2019. A few years back, the Academy Award\u2019s writers perhaps best satirized the focus group in a sketch (check it out here if you\u2019re interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh6mCImeylE ). One of the best stories I have ever heard about a focus group that actually worked in the director\u2019s favour is in relation to the 1981 movie Time Bandits. Terry Gilliam explained that the focus group screening in Fresno was a disaster, as the sound did not function properly for a good portion of the film. By the time it was fixed, a large number of the audience had departed. The motion picture has a rather controversial finale, yet the movie watchers that remained sardonically claimed that the ending was their favourite part (simply because the nightmarish experience was over). When the higher-ups received the breakdown of the cards filled out from the previous day, they witnessed what they thought was an off-the-charts appreciation for the ending \u2013 which Gilliam claims aided Time Bandits in keeping the original conclusion. [PAR] Time Bandits was recommended to me by actor/director G.J. Echternkamp. He has appeared in an episode of How I Met Your Mother, as well as in films like Hard Candy and Extraordinary Measures. He has also directed the award winning 2007 documentary Frank and Cindy, as well as the 2015 feature film of the same name. He is currently working on the newest Death Race film, Death Race 2050 starring Manu Bennett and Malcolm McDowell. When I spoke to him about his favourite film on the closing night of the inaugural St. Lawrence International Film Festival, he promptly highlighted Time Bandits as his top pick. Check out the interview below to hear a great explanation as to why it is his selection, as well as a rendition of an iconic quotation from his film Frank and Cindy. [PAR] Written by Monty Python alumni Michael Palin and the film\u2019s director Terry Gilliam, the story follows a young boy named Kevin (Craig Warnock) as he is swept up by a group of disgruntled dwarves (who are tired of working for the Supreme Being \u2013 so they have stolen his map that shows the space/time breaks in the fabric of the universe) and taken on a journey through time as they attempt to rob some of the richest people in the world\u2019s legendary history. [PAR] Their first stop takes them to France, where they meet the irascible Napoleon Bonaparte (Ian Holm), who is more interested in observing short people perform for him (or reciting famed historic figures of short stature) than in strategizing about the war that he is in the middle of. Kevin and the team of dwarves, which include Randall (David Rappaport), Fidgit (Kenny Baker \u2013 R2-D2 from Star Wars), Strutter (Malcolm Dixon), Og (Mike Edmonds), Wally (Jack Purvis) and Vermin (Tiny Ross), are hired as generals by the French leader following a chaotically violent rendition of \u2018Me and My Shadow\u2019 (that Napoleon loves).

He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\". His surviving works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and several other poems. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. [PAR] Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 at age 49, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, and there has been considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. [PAR] Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were mainly comedies and histories, genres he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the 16th century. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights. [PAR] Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. In 1623, two of his former theatrical colleagues published the First Folio, a collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's. [PAR] Shakespeare was a respected poet and playwright in his own day, but his reputation did not rise to its present heights until the 19th century. The Romantics, in particular, acclaimed Shakespeare's genius, and the Victorians worshipped Shakespeare with a reverence that George Bernard Shaw called \"bardolatry\". In the 20th century, his work was repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied, performed and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world. [PAR] Life [PAR] Early life [PAR] William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer. He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564. His actual birthdate remains unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, St George's Day. This date, which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar's mistake, has proved appealing to biographers, since Shakespeare died 23 April 1616. He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son. [PAR] Although no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford, a free school chartered in 1553, about a quarter-mile from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but the curriculum was dictated by law throughout England, and the school would have provided an intensive education in Latin grammar and the classics. [PAR] At the age of 18, Shakespeare married the 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence 27 November 1582. The next day two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage. The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste, since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times, and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised\n\n\n### Answer:\nhamlet </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

His mother tried various allopathic and hydropathic remedies on him during those early years, and his recollections of those instances (along with other memories of his growing up) would eventually find their way into Tom Sawyer and other writings. Because he was sickly, Clemens was often coddled, particularly by his mother, and he developed early the tendency to test her indulgence through mischief, offering only his good nature as bond for the domestic crimes he was apt to commit. When Jane Clemens was in her 80s, Clemens asked her about his poor health in those early years: \u201cI suppose that during that whole time you were uneasy about me?\u201d \u201cYes, the whole time,\u201d she answered. \u201cAfraid I wouldn\u2019t live?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cafraid you would.\u201d [PAR] Insofar as Clemens could be said to have inherited his sense of humour, it would have come from his mother, not his father. John Clemens, by all reports, was a serious man who seldom demonstrated affection. No doubt his temperament was affected by his worries over his financial situation, made all the more distressing by a series of business failures. It was the diminishing fortunes of the Clemens family that led them in 1839 to move 30 miles (50 km) east from Florida , Mo., to the Mississippi River port town of Hannibal , where there were greater opportunities. John Clemens opened a store and eventually became a justice of the peace, which entitled him to be called \u201cJudge\u201d but not to a great deal more. In the meantime, the debts accumulated. Still, John Clemens believed the Tennessee land he had purchased in the late 1820s (some 70,000 acres [28,000 hectares]) might one day make them wealthy, and this prospect cultivated in the children a dreamy hope. Late in his life, Twain reflected on this promise that became a curse: [PAR] It put our energies to sleep and made visionaries of us\u2014dreamers and indolent.\u2026It is good to begin life poor; it is good to begin life rich\u2014these are wholesome; but to begin it prospectively rich! The man who has not experienced it cannot imagine the curse of it. [PAR] Judging from his own speculative ventures in silver mining, business, and publishing, it was a curse that Sam Clemens never quite outgrew. [PAR] Perhaps it was the romantic visionary in him that caused Clemens to recall his youth in Hannibal with such fondness. As he remembered it in Old Times on the Mississippi (1875), the village was a \u201cwhite town drowsing in the sunshine of a summer\u2019s morning,\u201d until the arrival of a riverboat suddenly made it a hive of activity. The gamblers, stevedores, and pilots, the boisterous raftsmen and elegant travelers, all bound for somewhere surely glamorous and exciting, would have impressed a young boy and stimulated his already active imagination. And the lives he might imagine for these living people could easily be embroidered by the romantic exploits he read in the works of James Fenimore Cooper, Sir Walter Scott, and others. Those same adventures could be reenacted with his companions as well, and Clemens and his friends did play at being pirates, Robin Hood, and other fabled adventurers. Among those companions was Tom Blankenship, an affable but impoverished boy whom Twain later identified as the model for the character Huckleberry Finn. There were local diversions as well\u2014fishing, picnicking, and swimming. A boy might swim or canoe to and explore Glasscock\u2019s Island, in the middle of the Mississippi River, or he might visit the labyrinthine McDowell\u2019s Cave, about 2 miles (3 km) south of town. The first site evidently became Jackson\u2019s Island in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn; the second became McDougal\u2019s Cave in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. In the summers, Clemens visited his uncle John Quarles\u2019s farm, near Florida,\n\n\n### Answer:\nsamuel langhorne clemens </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Tutankhamen\u2019s sealed burial chambers were miraculously intact, and inside was a collection of several thousand priceless objects, including a gold coffin containing the mummy of the teenage king. [PAR] When Carter first arrived in Egypt, in 1891, most of the ancient Egyptian tombs had been discovered, and the majority of these had been hopelessly plundered by tomb raiders over the millennia. However, Carter was a brilliant excavator, and in the first years of the 20th century he discovered the tombs of Queen Hatshepsut and King Thutmose IV. Around 1907, he became associated with the Earl of Carnarvon, a collector of antiquities who commissioned Carter to supervise excavations in the Valley of the Kings. By 1913, most experts felt there was nothing in the Valley left to be uncovered. Carter, however, persisted in his efforts, convinced that the tomb of the little-known King Tutankhamen might still be found. [PAR] King Tutankhamen was enthroned in 1333 B.C. when he was still a child. He died a decade later at the age of 18 and thus made only a faint impression on the history of ancient Egypt. In the 13th century B.C., Tutankhamen and the other \u201cAmarna\u201d kings were publicly condemned, and most records of them were destroyed\u2013including the location of Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb. A century later, in the 12th century B.C., workers building a tomb for Ramses VI inadvertently covered Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb with a deep layer of chips, further protecting it from future discovery. [PAR] After World War I, Carter began an intensive search for Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb and on November 4, 1922, discovered a step leading to its entrance. Lord Carnarvon rushed to Egypt, and on November 23 they broke through a mud-brick door, revealing the passageway that led to Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb. There was evidence that robbers had entered the structure at some point, and the archaeologists feared they had discovered yet another pillaged tomb. However, on November 26 they broke through another door, and Carter leaned in with a candle to take a look. Behind him, Lord Carnarvon asked, \u201cCan you see anything?\u201d Carter replied, \u201cYes, wonderful things.\u201d [PAR] It was the antechamber of Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb, and it was gloriously untouched. The dusty floor still showed the footprints of the tomb builders who left the room more than 3,000 years before. Apparently, the robbers who had broken into Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb had done so soon after it was completed and were caught before moving into the interior chambers and causing serious damage. [PAR] Thus began a monumental excavation process in which Carter carefully explored the four-room tomb over several years, uncovering an incredible collection of several thousand objects. In addition to numerous pieces of jewelry and gold, there was statuary, furniture, clothes, a chariot, weapons, and numerous other objects that shed a brilliant light on the culture and history of ancient Egypt. The most splendid find was a stone sarcophagus containing three coffins nested within each other. Inside the final coffin, made out of solid gold, was the mummified body of the boy-king Tutankhamen, preserved for 3,200 years. Most of these treasures are now housed in the Cairo Museum.

It was created in the United Kingdom by Eric Morley in 1951.   Since his death in 2000, Morley's widow, Julia Morley, has co-chaired the pageant.   Alongside with its rival, the Miss Universe and Miss Earth contests, Miss World pageant is one of the three most publicised beauty contests in the world.     [PAR] The current Miss World is Mireia Lalaguna of Spain who was crowned on 19 December 2015 in Sanya, China PR. [PAR] 20th century  [PAR] In 1951, Eric Morley organised a bikini contest as part of the Festival of Britain celebrations that he called the Festival Bikini Contest.  The event was popular with the press, and was dubbed \"Miss World\" by the media. The swimsuit competition was intended as a promotion for the bikini  which had only recently been introduced onto the market, and which was still widely regarded as immodest. When the 1951 Miss World pageant winner, Kerstin \"Kiki\" Hakansson from Sweden, was crowned in a bikini, it added to the controversy. [PAR] The pageant was originally planned as a Pageant for the Festival of Britain, but Eric Morley decided to make the Miss World pageant an annual event.   Morley registered the \"Miss World\" name as a trademark,  and all future pageants were held under that name. However, because of the controversy arising from H\u00e5kansson's crowning in a bikini, countries with religious traditions threatened not to send delegates to future events, and the bikini was condemned by the Pope.  Objection to the bikini led to its replacement in all future pageants  with what was accepted as more modest swimwear, and from 1976 swimsuits were replaced by evening gowns for the crowning.  H\u00e5kansson remains the only Miss World crowned in a bikini. In Miss World 2013 all participants wore a one-piece swimsuit plus a traditional sarong below the waist as a compromise with local culture.  [PAR] Miss World Order or I\u2019ll give you the results in reverse order. Morley announced the Miss World winners in the order No 3, No 2 and No 1. This keeps the tension up and avoids the anticlimax if Nos 2 and 3 are announced after the winner. [PAR]   [PAR] In 1959, the BBC started broadcasting the pageant. The pageant's popularity grew with the advent of television. During the 1960s and 1970s, Miss World would be among the most watched programs of the year on British television.  However, in 1970, the Miss World contest in London was disrupted by women's liberation protesters armed with flour bombs, stink bombs, and water pistols.  [PAR] In the 1980s, the pageant repositioned itself with the slogan Beauty With a Purpose, with added tests of intelligence and personality.  However, there have been various objections to the contest.   Although it still \"enjoys success worldwide, it was last broadcast on UK televisions in 1998.\"Brooke Magnanti.

[PAR] The BBC picked it up the next year for a full series, but neither they nor writers Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais can have known quite what a phenomenon they'd created with the show they thought of calling Bird or Stir, before settling on another euphemism for life behind bars, Porridge. [PAR] When the new show first aired in 1974 it was greeted with outrage in sections of the tabloid press, shocked at the notion of a comedy programme glorifying prison. [PAR] Little time was needed, though, before any complaints were drowned out underneath a chorus of critical acclaim and public adoration for what remains one of the most classic British sitcoms ever produced. [PAR] Fletcher himself is an old hand at 'doing time', and we meet him serving a five-year stretch at HMP Prison Slade for breaking and entering - each episode would begin with the booming voice of the judge (recorded by Barker) passing sentence and the stark slamming of prison doors. [PAR] Fletcher expects to enjoy a single cell but he's forced to share with a first-time offender, a na\u00efve, young Brummie called Lennie Godber (played by Richard Beckinsale). [PAR] Fletcher reluctantly takes Godber under his wing and helps him to 'keep his nose clean' but together they always end up getting into trouble (often for reasons beyond their control), either with other inmates or the prison officers at Slade. [PAR] While the richly comic dialogue between the two cell-mates was a joy to watch, Clement and Le Frenais' wonderful writing didn't stop there, and they populated HMP Slade with a host of memorably eccentric characters, from kindly but senile Blanco (played ingeniously by a young David Jason), disgraced dentist Harris and dim-witted Warren to the irascible Scot MacLaren, conman Ives and the prison Mr Big, Harry Grout. [PAR] While Fletcher's knowledge and experience saw him regarded highly by most fellow inmates, it didn't stop him being used and blackmailed from time to time by Grout, who'd often force Fletch into tasks against his will. [PAR] It was Fletcher's day-to-day job to juggle life on the landings with not getting caught by the wardens, which meant taking advantage of the kind-hearted and soft-natured Mr Barrowclough, and sidestepping the eagle eye of the harsh, suspicious Mr MacKay (portrayed with delicious menace by Fulton McKay). [PAR] Episodes would usually involve Fletcher and Godber getting into trouble but somehow scoring a minor victory, usually against MacKay. The glee Barker injected into Fletcher's little triumphs was magical to watch. [PAR] Porridge is probably the classic realisation of the sitcom method of putting characters in a situation where they're trapped with each other. [PAR] In Fletcher's case it was with his cell-mate Godber, and the wonderful relationship between the pair in the scripts was elevated to pure gold by the sparkling chemistry between he two leads, Barker and Beckinsale. [PAR] Writers Clement and Le Frenais were so successful that the show became essential viewing inside Britain's real jails, and prisoners claimed it was the most accurate portrayal of real prison life on TV. [PAR] Its massive success spawned a superior spin-off movie and a Bafta-winning sitcom sequel Going Straight, set around Fletcher's life on release from Slade, before more episodes were curtailed by the untimely death of Richard Beckinsale in 1979. [PAR] Porridge was a show never afraid to throw into the mix scenes of true drama, as Godber and sometimes even Fletcher occasionally struggled to cope with the grind of being stuck behind bars. [PAR] The way in which such moments were woven into episodes, adding depth and realism to the series without ever diminishing the humour, is yet another reason why it remains unarguably one of the all-time classics.[DOC] [TLE] David JasonSir David John White,  (born 2 February 1940), better known by his stage name David Jason, is an English actor\n\n\n### Answer:\nporridge </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

He is opposed to the harmony of things and is capable of  destroying all life. He is a figure of confusion and chaos. Although initially regarded as a fairly benevolent god, in later Egyptian belief Seth was regarded as a demonic figure. [PAR] Seth is one of the most complex and ambiguous Egyptian gods; myths about Seth depict him as ambitious, scheming, manipulative, and a murderer. In many ways, Seth resembles a devil in Judeo-Christian belief. [PAR] Seth is not a creator god, but Ra ther a god of the desert and barren lands. He is therefore jealous of his brother Horus , who inherited the fertile lands of Egypt.  It is also called the \"red god, the god of great power\", Master of thunder, lightning and disorder, the god of the desert and aridity, foreign countries: Egyptians both revered and feared this dread god. Seth was worshiped in secret cults in Ancient Egypt that p Ra cticed human sacrifice. These sects were suppressed by the official religion, but persisted throughout the centuries. [PAR] Indeed Seth was cent Ra l to the Osiris myth, in which Osiris was sacrificed and then reborn, in a symbolic representation of the seasons and the rebirth of the land as a result of the annual Nile flooding. Seth murdered his brother Osiris out of jealousy by drowning Osiris in the Nile. Osiris 's wife Isis , found the body and buried him which angered Seth, who then desec Ra ted the body by cutting it into pieces and scattering it throughout Egypt. Isis , indefatigable widow, found thirteen of the fourteen parts of her beloved (The missing part is the sex of Osiris , on this occasion called her \"talisman\"). Then Isis rebuilds Osiris , breathes the breath of eternal life into him, and by magic produces a son, Horus (Hor). [PAR] Driven by his infinite jealousy, Seth is also the enemy of Horus , the postmortem son born to Isis and Osiris . Horus is the legal heir to the crown of Egypt but Seth refuses to pay homage, and seizes power by force. A tribunal of the gods is convened by Horus 's mother Isis at which the sun god Ra presides. Thoth acts as notary and records the proceedings. [PAR] The mills of the gods grind slowly and eighty years pass while the gods debate whether Seth or Horus should prevail.  As the debates are just going in circles, with no clear winner, Toth turns to the goddess Sais, who is renowned for her wisdom. Her answer is unambiguous: the crown back to Horus . However, to avoid penalizing Seth, Neith proposes to offer the goddesses Anat and Astarte as wives. [PAR] But Seth does not accept this compromise and the debate continues. Isis objects, and is barred from the tribunal on orders of Seth. But Isis returns in disguise, as a beautiful young woman who catches the eye of Seth. Seth is dist Ra cted by her beauty and confides in the disguised Isis , that Horus is the legitimate heir. At this point the ruse is revealed and Ra , who had previously supported Seth realizes that he is imprudent and unworthy of the crown because he was so quick to confide in a st Ra nger. Ra then takes the crown away from Seth and places it on Horus himself. [PAR] But Seth, eternally jealous, still would not give up and challenged Horus to games to decide the winner. And so the battle continues. Ra , anxious to bring peace between the uncle and nephew, invites them to a banquet. Seth pretends to be reconciled to Horus , and then invites Horus to his house. But while Horus is sleeping, Seth steals Horus 's semen (I will leave the details out) in an effort to feminize Horus and make him unworthy to rule.

First airing as a Comedy Playhouse pilot, the show aired in seven series until 1975. Six years later, ITV continued the sitcom, calling it Till Death.... From 1985 to 1992, the BBC produced a sequel In Sickness and in Health. [PAR] Created by Johnny Speight, Till Death Us Do Part centred on the East End Garnett family, led by patriarch Alf Garnett (Warren Mitchell), a reactionary white working-class man who holds racist and anti-socialist views. His long-suffering wife Else was played by Dandy Nichols, and his daughter Rita by Una Stubbs. Rita's husband Mike Rawlins (Anthony Booth) is a socialist layabout. The character Alf Garnett became a well known character in British culture, and Mitchell played him on stage and television up until Speight's death in 1998. [PAR] In addition to the spin-off In Sickness and in Health, Till Death Us Do Part was re-made in many countries including Brazil, Germany (Ein Herz und eine Seele), the Netherlands (In Voor- En Tegenspoed), and is known to the United States as the show that inspired All in the Family. [PAR] Many episodes from the first three series are thought to no longer exist, having been wiped in the late 1960s and early '70s as was the policy at the time. [PAR] Series  [PAR] Success years  [PAR] The series became an instant hit because, although a comedy, in the context of its time it did deal with aspects of working class life comparatively realistically. It addressed racial and political issues at a difficult time in British society. The attitude of those who made the programme was that Alf's views were so clearly unacceptable that they were risible, but someconsidered the series uncomfortable and disturbing. Some were oblivious to the fact that Johnny Speight was satirising racist attitudes. Ironically, many who held similar opinions to the character enjoyed the show, perhaps missing the point that Alf's opinions were considered offensive and that they were being ridiculed. Mitchell imbued the character of Alf Garnett with an earthy charm that served to humanise Alf and make him likable. According to interviews he gave, the fact that some viewers overlooked Alf's views and regarded him as a rough diamond disappointed Speight. [PAR] The show captured a key feature of Britain in the 1960s - the widening generation gap. Alf (and to a lesser degree his wife) represented the old guard, the traditional and conservative attitudes of the older generation. Alf's battles with his left-wing son-in-law were not just ideological but generational and cultural. His son-in-law and daughter represented the younger generation. They supported the  aspects of the new era such as relaxed sexual mores, fashions, music, etc. The same things were anathema to Alf - and indicative of everything that was wrong with the younger generation and the liberal attitudes they embraced. [PAR] Alf was portrayed as the archetypal working-class Conservative. The subjects that excited him most were football and politics, though his actual knowledge of either was limited. He used language not considered acceptable for television in the 1960s. He often referred to racial minorities as \"coons\" and similar terms. He referred to his Liverpudlian son-in-law as \"Shirley Temple\" or a \"randy Scouse git\" (Randy Scouse Git, as a phrase, caught the ear of Micky Dolenz of The Monkees who heard it while on tour in the UK and used it as the title of the group's following single - though their record label renamed it 'Alternate Title' in the UK market to avoid controversy), and to his wife as a \"silly [old] moo\" (a substitute for 'cow' which was vetoed by the BBC's head of comedy Frank Muir).

The last ruler of what historians call the \u201cJulio-Claudian\u201d dynasty, he ruled until he committed suicide in June, A.D. 68. [PAR] Famously known for the apocryphal story that he fiddled while Rome burned in a great fire, Nero has become one of the most infamous men who ever lived. During his rule, he murdered his own mother, Agrippina the Younger; his first wife, Octavia; and allegedly, his second wife, Poppaea Sabina. In addition, ancient writers claim that he started the great fire of Rome in A.D. 64 so that he could re-build the city center. [PAR] Yet, despite the numerous charges that have been levelled by ancient writers, there is evidence that Nero enjoyed some level of popular support. He had a passion for music and the arts, an interest that culminated in a public performance he gave in Rome in A.D. 65. Also, while he was blamed for starting the fire, he took it upon himself to organize relief efforts, and ancient writers make other allusions to acts of charity that he performed. [PAR] \u201cHe let slip no opportunity for acts of generosity and mercy, or even for displaying his affability,\u201d wrote the otherwise critical Suetonius in the 2nd century A.D. ( translation by J. C. Rolfe). [PAR] Recently, a newly translated poem has been published, and it depicts Nero in a positive light. It tells of the deification of his dead wife Poppaea Sabina, concluding with her watching over Nero from the heavens . Scholars were surprised to discover that the text, which proclaims Nero a man \u201cequal to the gods,\u201d dates to about two centuries after Nero\u2019s death, suggesting that some individuals in the Roman Empire held a favorable view of him long after his death. [PAR] Early life [PAR] Nero was born in Antium, in Italy, on Dec. 15, A.D. 37, to his mother, Agrippina the Younger, and his father, Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus. His father, a former Roman consul, died when he was about 3 years old, and his mother was banished by the Emperor Caligula, leaving him in the care of an aunt. His name at birth was Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. [PAR] After the murder of Caligula in January A.D. 41, and the ascension of Emperor Claudius shortly afterward, mother and son were reunited. His ambitious mother would go on to marry Claudius (who was also her uncle) in A.D. 49, and she saw to it that he adopted her son, giving him a new name that started with \u201cNero.\u201d His tutors included the famous philosopher Seneca, a man who would continue advising Nero into his reign, even writing the proclamation explaining why Nero killed his mother. [PAR] The newly adopted son would later take the hand of his stepsister, Octavia, in marriage, and become Claudius\u2019 heir apparent, the emperor choosing him over his own biological son, Britannicus (who died shortly after Nero became emperor). [PAR] After the death of Claudius in A.D. 54 (possibly by being poisoned with a mushroom), Nero, with the support of the Praetorian Guard and at the age of 17, became emperor. In the first two years of Nero\u2019s reign, his coins depicted him side by side with his mother, Agrippina.

[PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Subscribe to our Question of the Week : [PAR] Question: \"Why did Noah release a raven? Why did he later release a dove (Genesis 8)?\" [PAR] Answer: Following the Genesis flood, as the ark was resting on Mount Ararat, Noah released a raven and dove from the ark at different times. The goal in sending these birds was to determine if the flood waters had abated enough for Noah and his family to exit the ark. [PAR] In Genesis 8:6-7 we read, \u201cAt the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.\u201d The \u201c40 days\u201d here is after the tops of the mountains were visible (verse 5), over seven months after the flood began. A raven was released and apparently never returned. No reason is provided regarding why a raven was selected rather than another bird. However, raven can eat carrion and would feed off dead animals in the water. A dove, on the other hand, would return to its point of origin if no land was found. [PAR] Noah sent a dove in Genesis 8:8-9: \u201cThen he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground. But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him.\u201d The dove returned with no indication that a place had been found to alight. [PAR] A week later, in Genesis 8:10-11, Noah sent the dove again: \u201cHe waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark. And the dove came back to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.\u201d Things had begun to grow once again; the earth was becoming more habitable. [PAR] Another week passed. Then, in Genesis 8:12, Noah sends out the dove one more time: \u201cThen he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him anymore.\u201d The dove had no need to return to the ark, since it had found a home on land. The ark could soon be emptied, and humanity could begin to establish itself again in the world. [PAR] From Genesis 7:11 to 8:14, we know that the flood lasted a total of one year and ten days. The raven and the dove were released over a period of 21 days after the mountaintops became visible (Genesis 8:10-12). The raven served as a first attempt to discover dry land, and the dove became Noah\u2019s way of determining when to leave the ark.[DOC] [TLE] What was Noah thinking when he sent a raven from the ark?genesis - What was Noah thinking when he sent a raven from the ark? - Biblical Hermeneutics Stack Exchange [PAR] What was Noah thinking when he sent a raven from the ark?

Anderson [PAR] January 19, 2016 [PAR] Manfred von Richthofen, the infamous Red Baron , was the most successful German fighter pilot of World War I. However, there were other German aces who were arguably better and more skilled than he was. [PAR] 10 Max Immelmann [PAR] The legendary Max Immelmann was Germany\u2019s first ever ace. He was also the first aviator to be decorated with the country\u2019s highest military medal, the Pour le Merite, which became known as \u201cThe Blue Max\u201d in his honor. Born in September 1890, Immelmann rejoined the German military as a pilot when the war began. He had previously enlisted as a 14-year-old cadet before leaving in 1912 to study. [PAR] During his first assignment (to deliver supplies and mail between aerodromes), Immelmann was honored with the Iron Cross, Second Class, for landing his badly damaged aircraft within German lines. His first victory came on August 1, 1915, when he downed one of 10 British aircraft that attacked Germany\u2019s Douai aerodrome, earning him the Iron Cross, First Class. [PAR] In October 1915, Immelmann single-handedly protected the French city of Lille from being captured by Allied pilots. This earned him the nickname \u201cAdler von Lille\u201d (\u201c The Eagle of Lille \u201c) from the German public. In one of his exploits over the skies of Lille, he came across the duo of Captain O\u2019Hara Wood and Ira Jones in a BE-2c. Although they had lost their gun early into the battle, they were lucky to escape unhurt, as Immelmann ran out of ammunition. By January 1916, he\u2019d become Germany\u2019s first ace after his eighth dogfight victory and was awarded the Pour le Merite. [PAR] On June 18, 1916, The Eagle of Lille met his end. Like many aces, the cause of Immelmann\u2019s death is disputed. While the Allies claimed he was shot down by Lieutenant G.R. McCubbin and his gunner, Corporal J.H., in an FE-2, German authorities stated that he was the victim of friendly anti-aircraft fire. The final tally of Immelmann\u2019s dogfight victories is put at 15, although some sources believe it stood at 17. [PAR] 9 Oswald Boelcke [PAR] During wars, very few people are revered by both sides. Oswald Boelcke was one such person during World War I. He entered the army at the advent of the war in 1914 as an observer with his brother, Wilhelm. He soon transferred to a fighter squadron, Section 62, where he scored his first kill in August 1915. He became friends with Max Immelmann, and they formed a fruitful rivalry. [PAR] In January 1916, Boelcke scored his eighth victory on the same day as Immelmann, becoming Germany\u2019s second ace. They were the first pilots to be awarded the Pour le Merite. After Immelmann\u2019s death in June, Boelcke was ordered by the kaiser not to fly for one month to prevent losing him. While on the ground, he pushed for reforms that led to the reorganization of the Imperial Army Air Service. Preaching the use of formation fighting instead of individual efforts, Boelcke inspired the establishment of the Jasta squadrons. As the leader of the newly established Jasta 2, he picked the trio of Manfred von Richthofen, Hans Reimann, and Erwin Boehme as his underlings. [PAR] Although Boelcke had the blood of many Allied pilots on his hands, he also garnered fame as one of the few gentlemen pilots to grace the skies. Days after his first victory, he saved a French boy from drowning in a canal near a German aerodrome. He was honored with the Prussian Lifesaving Medal after every effort by the boy\u2019s parents to have him awarded with the French Legion d\u2019Honneur was rebuffed. Another memorable exploit of his took place in January 1916, when he brought down two British flyers. While visiting one of the pilots in the hospital, he was handed a letter to deliver, which he did by dropping it behind enemy lines despite heavy fire.

[PAR] Painting Techniques of the Renaissance. [PAR] The Fresco technique. [PAR] \u00a0Fresco painting has been around for a very long time, examples of fresco painting\u00a0techniques date back to at least 1500 BC. But the use of the medium became very prominent in the medieval and renaissance periods. There are three main painting mediums that were used in the renaissance, these are Fresco, (discussed here) Egg Tempera and Oil painting . [PAR] There are varying types of fresco, true fresco or Buon fresco is very permanent and consists of brush painting onto freshly applied, wet lime plaster (referred to as the intonaco.) Using water as the medium the paint is absorbed into the plaster as it dries and the pigment is bound into the structure of the plaster. [PAR] Wall painting was very popular in the renaissance era and fresco was the standard method of decoration.\u00a0 [PAR] The area to be painted was first covered with an under layer of plaster named the\u00a0 arriccio. Often the artists would sketch their compositions on this under layer in a red pigment called\u00a0sinopia.\u00a0The artist could not make changes in the composition of the painting and had only the drying time of the plaster in which to complete his work (about 8 or 9 hours). [PAR] Because of the drying time only enough intonaco was applied for a single days work. If mistakes were made the entire days layer of plaster would have to be removed. [PAR] The giornata is the name given to a single days work and in fresco paintings the dividing lines between differing days work can very often be seen. These seems between the layers of plaster were often hidden by an application of Secco fresco. [PAR] A layer of plaster arriccio with a preparatory drawing of red [PAR] \u00a0pigment, the sinopia. [PAR] further painting was added each day. [PAR] Finally the work was completed. [PAR] \u00a0This is Giotto's Adoration of the Magi and the artist has used both the\u00a0Buon and Secco \u00a0techniques in this painting.\u00a0\u00a0 [PAR] \u00a0Secco fresco is used on\u00a0dry plaster, pigment is applied using egg or size as the medium and also as a binder for the paint. In the secco fresco technique the paint is not\u00a0 [PAR] absorbed into the structure of the plaster but forms a surface layer which tends to flake off and is therefore not so permanent as Buon fresco. Secco fresco\u00a0is often used in conjunction with the buon method, secco is faster and allows for mistakes to be corrected.\u00a0 [PAR] \u00a0A third type of fresco, mezzo-fresco, common at the end of the sixteenth century, was an intonaco that was painted when the surface was almost dry. The pigment only slightly penetrates the surface of the plaster retaining much of the colour that varied considerably when painting into wet plaster. [PAR] \u00a0Artists of the renaissance worked in slightly different ways when working in fresco. Typically the artist would work from a top corner of the painting and gradually apply the paint from top to bottom, working a stage each day until completion. This method avoided damaging or splattering finished sections with paint. [PAR] Instead of using the red pigment\u00a0sinopia for the under painting many artists used preparatory drawings on paper. The drawings would be held against the wall and the main lines pricked through, a bag of soot would be banged along the holes producing dots giving the outline of the work. Given that fresco painting did not allow mistakes to be easily rectified, the drawings became\u00a0important in producing a coherent composition for the finished work. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 [PAR] \u00a0Many of the worlds greatest cycles of paintings have been completed using fresco painting techniques\u00a0and they include the example above from\u00a0the Scrovegni Chapel . \u00a0 [PAR] \u00a0 Michelangelo's work in the Sistine Chapel is a fine (and very famous) example of the \u00a0type of result that can be achieved with the medium, executed by a master craftsman at the height of his powers.[DOC] [TLE] How to Make a Fresco Painting: 9 Steps (with Pictures)How to Make a Fresco Painting: 9 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow [PAR] How to Make a Fresco Painting [PAR] Community Q&A [PAR] Affresco\n\n\n### Answer:\nfresco </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Soon after, Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, making the king head of the English church. Although Catherine was loved by the English people, she was forced to spend the last years of her life isolated from all public life. [PAR] Anne Boleyn was the second wife of King Henry VIII. They were privately married in January 1533, but the marriage did not become known until Easter of that year. Anne Boleyn was the mother of the future Queen Elizabeth I, born in September of 1533. During their marriage Henry quickly lost interest in Anne and began to have affairs with other women. All Anne had to do to save their marriage was provide a male heir for the King. After two attempts she failed. Committed to the Tower of London, Anne was charged with adultery and alleged to have been involved in several affairs. On May 19, 1536, she was convicted by a unanimous vote and beheaded. According to many historians, it is very likely that Anne was innocent, but she was declared guilty because of a temporary court faction supported by Thomas Cromwell. [PAR] Jane Seymour, the mother of King Edward VI, was the third wife of King Henry VIII. Jane was the daughter of one of the King's knights. In Henry's attempts to win Jane, he sent her a love letter and a purse. Jane sent the letter and the purse back unopened with a touching message about her family's honor. The King promised to defend the honor, and they were married May 30, 1536. Jane was the first and only wife to provide King Henry VIII with a proper male heir. However, Jane was unable to recover from the birth and died twelve days later. [PAR] The fourth wife of King Henry was Anne of Cleves, a German princess. They were married for political reasons; in fact, Anne was chosen by Thomas Cromwell,\n\n\n### Answer:\nqueen anne boleyn </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Jareth is the film's main antagonist, and also appears in much of the tie-in material produced to compliment the film, including its novelization and its manga sequel . [PAR] Contents [PAR] Edit [PAR] Jareth and Sarah looking out at the Labyrinth. [PAR] Jareth has the power to transform into a white barn-owl, and is first seen watching Sarah in this form as she recites lines from the play The Labyrinth . [PAR] Jareth first appears in the film in his human form when he is summoned by Sarah to take her infant brother Toby away from her. Jareth attempts to make Sarah give up her brother by offering her a crystal that will reveal her dreams, only for her to refuse. Jareth transports both himself and Sarah to a hill overlooking his Labyrinth and tells her she has thirteen hours to save Toby. He then vanishes, leaving Sarah alone on the hill-top to start her journey. [PAR] He is next seen in his castle , surrounded by his drunk, clumsy goblin subjects. He rises from his throne and begins to interact with his subjects through the song Magic Dance , which he uses to express his delight at having Toby in his possession. [PAR] When Sarah falls into the Oubliette, Jareth is perturbed by the speed of her progress through the Labyrinth. He declares that he plans to send Hoggle to fetch her and take her back to the start of the Labyrinth, and laughs at the thought of hindering her progress. [PAR] Disguising himself as a blind, shabby beggar, Jareth waits for Sarah and Hoggle in the passage leading away from the Oubliette, attracting their attention with one of his crystals. He does away with his disguise as soon as they appear, asking Hoggle to explain why he appears to be helping Sarah instead of taking her back to the start of the Labyrinth as he was ordered to. Quickly losing interest in Hoggle, Jareth approaches Sarah and asks for her opinion on his Labyrinth. Her flippant response causes him to lose his patience with her, takes some of her time to save Toby away, and he sends the Cleaners after both Sarah and Hoggle as punishment. [PAR] Jareth's next significant appearance is an encounter with Hoggle, where he gives a peach to Hoggle that he orders him to give to Sarah. When asked if the peach will harm Sarah, Jareth taunts Hoggle and ridicules the idea that Sarah could consider \"a repulsive little scab\" such as him a friend. In parting, he tells Hoggle he will make him 'Prince of the Land of Stench' should Sarah should ever kiss him. He soon fulfils this promise, causing a trap door that leads to The Bog of Eternal Stench to open beneath both Sarah and Hoggle when Sarah kisses Hoggle in gratitude for him having saved her. Later, when Hoggle is about the drop the peach into the bog, Jareth's disembodied voice tells him \"I wouldn't do that if I were you\" and Hoggle returns the peach to his pocket. [PAR] David Bowie as Jareth in Labyrinth. [PAR] When Sarah eats the drugged peach, Jareth is seen on the window-sill of his throne room, casting crystals out into the sky that travel towards Sarah and draw her into a dream-world. The dream-world consists of a lavish ball, where Jareth watches Sarah from the crowd. Jareth is elusive at first, deliberately hiding from Sarah as she wanders through the ballroom, confused and disorientated. Jareth dances with a number of women, however his attention is always focused on Sarah. Eventually, he approaches her and draws her into a dance, singing the love ballad As The World Falls Down to her as they move across the ballroom. Sarah is eventually distracted by the sight of a clock that indicates her time is running out, and she pulls herself free from Jareth and flees. Jareth watches her run from him, and is lost from sight in the crowd.

[PAR] What Is the Meaning of Albatross in Golf? [PAR] by William McCoy [PAR] Gene Sarazen was the first professional golfer to score an albatross in a modern major tournament. [PAR] Matthew Stockman/Getty Images Sport/Getty Images [PAR] More Articles [PAR] Fun Games to Play in a Scramble Golf Tournament [PAR] In golf, an albatross is something that most golfers will never have the fortune to make. This scoring term, which represents three strokes under par on a single hole, is extremely difficult to achieve. Several professional golfers have scored an albatross in a tour event, but the list remains relatively short compared with the number of holes collectively played by all the golfers in PGA Tour and LPGA Tour history. [PAR] Overview [PAR] Scoring an albatross on a given hole requires that you are playing on a par-5 hole. If you were to hole out three shots below par on a par-4, this accomplishment would technically be called a hole-in-one rather than an albatross. On a par-5 hole, you would need to sink your second shot to achieve an albatross. This feat likely would require precision and luck with a second shot that most likely is 200 or more yards from the green. [PAR] Notable Albatrosses [PAR] PGA Tour legend Gene Sarazen was the first professional golfer to record an albatross in one of golf's four modern major events, and he did so when the stakes were high. Sarazen earned this rare score on the par-5 15th hole of the 1935 Masters, which forced a tie for the lead and a subsequent playoff that he won. Other pro golfers, including Jack Nicklaus, Shaun Micheel and Joey Sindelar, have scored albatrosses in their careers. A notable, recent albatross and belongs to Nicholas Thompson, who achieved the feat at the 2009 Fry.com Open. After making an albatross on the par-5 11th hole, he made a hole-in-one on the par-3 13th hole. The back-to-back albatross and hole-in-one is an extremely rare occurrence in the game. [PAR] Odds [PAR] The National Hole in One Association, which tracks holes-in-one and sets odds for the feat, states that an albatross is less likely than an elusive hole-in-one. The association sets a golfer's odds of making a hole-in-one at 12,700 to 1 or, for a professional, 3,700 to 1. The odds of achieving an albatross, meanwhile, are set at 6 million to 1. [PAR] Considerations [PAR] One of the factors that makes scoring an albatross even more difficult is that most golf courses only provide golfers with two to five opportunities to achieve the feat. Because it's only possible on a par-5 hole, this limits your chances of an albatross to the number of par-5 holes on the course. Although you have a chance to make a 1-under-par birdie or even a 2-under-par eagle on any hole on any given course, the albatross remains highly elusive.

It was my most difficult book \u2013 the book that treated a theme which was so distant, so remote, from my own emotional life that it gave me a special pleasure to use my combinational talent to make it real.\u201d [PAR] The author\u2019s passion for this erotic tragicomedy is part of its charm and its appeal. Nabokov knows he is crossing boundaries of good taste but he exults in his truancy from convention anyway. Everything, and everyone, is up for grabs. From the famous opening line, Lolita is the work of a writer in love with the potentiality of the English language: \u201cLolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.\u201d Nabokov\u2019s novel is both a comic tour de force and a transgressive romp. As Martin Amis , a devoted advocate, has written, Lolita is \u201cboth irresistible and unforgivable\u201d. [PAR] Subtitled \u201cthe confessions of a white widowed male\u201d, the novel is an intoxicating mix of apologia, prison diary and urgent appeal to the members of a jury by a 38-year old defendant, Dr Humbert Humbert, a professor of literature. Humbert, who is obsessed with \u201cnymphets\u201d (Nabokov\u2019s coinage), girls on the edge of puberty, has been charged with the murder of Clare Quilty, a playwright. As Humbert\u2019s confession unfolds, in two unequal parts \u2013 the latter a travelogue that prompted Christopher Isherwood to joke that it was \u201cthe best travel book ever written about America\u201d \u2013 the reader discovers that his defence is \u201ccrime of passion\u201d: he slaughtered Quilty out of love for Dolores Haze, his \u201cLolita\u201d. [PAR] Although we see him drugging the love object of his dreams, Humbert is hardly debauching an innocent. In a twist that makes for uncomfortable reading in the context of contemporary anxieties about child abuse, Nabokov establishes that Lolita is sexually precocious already. When it comes to the moment when she and Humbert are \u201ctechnically lovers\u201d, it was, in Nabokov\u2019s brilliant and clinical reversal, \u201cshe who seduced me\u201d. [PAR] A note on the text [PAR] Nabokov\u2019s mother tongue was Russian, just as Joseph Conrad \u2019s was Polish. But, like Conrad, he takes his place here as a master of the English (and American) language. Nabokov\u2019s own retrospective account, dated 12 November 1956, \u201cOn a book entitled Lolita\u201d, provides the essential narrative of his novel\u2019s gestation. [PAR] He writes that \u201cthe first little throb of Lolita went through me late in 1939, or early in 1940, in Paris.\u201d At the time, he says, he was \u201claid up with a severe attack of intercostal neuralgia\u201d. The upshot of this \u201clittle throb\u201d was \u201ca short story some 30 pages long\u201d, written in Russian. But Nabokov was displeased with this preliminary sketch and says he \u201cdestroyed it some time after moving to America in 1940\u201d. [PAR] But the fever-germ of his masterpiece was lodged in his imagination. In 1949, he continues, \u201cthe throbbing, which had never quite ceased, began to plague me again\u201d. Now writing in English as a would-be American, he began a new version. Progress was painfully slow. \u201cOther books intervened,\u201d he writes, but still he could not reconcile himself to consigning his unfinished draft to the incinerator. [PAR] Meanwhile, the exiled Nabokov, a distinguished lepidopterist, could never resist the lure of errant butterflies.\n\n\n### Answer:\nlolita </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

The president\u2019s death came only six days after Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered his massive army at Appomattox, effectively ending the American Civil War. [PAR] Booth, who remained in the North during the war despite his Confederate sympathies, initially plotted to capture President Lincoln and take him to Richmond, the Confederate capital. However, on March 20, 1865, the day of the planned kidnapping, the president failed to appear at the spot where Booth and his six fellow conspirators lay in wait. Two weeks later, Richmond fell to Union forces. In April, with Confederate armies near collapse across the South, Booth hatched a desperate plan to save the Confederacy.

There's got to be a reason (perhaps, several) why Chupas are the most popular lollipop in the entire world... First, the name catches the ear. Chupa Chups derives from the Spanish verb \"chupar,\" which means \"to suck.\" And while one can lick or suck a Chupa, Chupa Chups definitely don't suck. They're quite likely the tastiest lollipops on Earth! Chupa Chups boast the unique Cremosa flavors: choco-vanilla, strawberry-vanilla, mango yogurt, strawberry yogurt, choco-banana, and choco-cherry -- all super creamy and super delicious. Nor shall we forget the convenient plastic stick and the tight double wrapper that keeps that delectable 12 gram pop so fresh. And what other lollipop (or candy of any sort) can boast a logo designed by the great Spanish surrealist artist Salvador Dali?\u00a0 Only Chupa Chups with it's bright yellow, red, and gold daisy can make that claim, amigo. And what was the first lollipop in outer space?\u00a0 That's right, Chupa Chups!

His reign saw the fall of the Russian Empire from being one of the foremost great powers of the world to economic and military collapse. Due to the Khodynka Tragedy, anti-Semitic pogroms, Bloody Sunday, the violent suppression of the 1905 Revolution, the execution of political opponents and his perceived responsibility for the Russo-Japanese War, he was given the nickname Nicholas the Bloody by his political enemies.  [PAR] Russia suffered a decisive defeat in the Russo-Japanese War, which saw the annihilation of the Russian Baltic Fleet at the Battle of Tsushima, loss of Russian influence over Manchuria and Korea, and the Japanese annexation of South Sakhalin. The Anglo-Russian Entente, designed to counter German attempts to gain influence in the Middle East, ended the Great Game between Russia and the United Kingdom. As head of state, Nicholas approved the Russian mobilization in late July 1914, which led to Germany declaring war on Russia on 1 August. It is estimated that around 3.3 million Russians were killed in World War I.  The Imperial Army's severe losses and the High Command's incompetent management of the war efforts, along with the lack of food and other supplies on the Home Front, were the leading causes of the fall of the Romanov dynasty. [PAR] Following the February Revolution of 1917 Nicholas abdicated on behalf of himself and his son, and he and his family were imprisoned. In the spring of 1918, Nicholas was handed over to the local Ural Soviet; with the approval of Lenin, Nicholas and his family were eventually executed by the Bolsheviks on the night of 16\u201317 July 1918. The recovered remains of the Imperial Family were finally re-interred in St. Petersburg in 1998. [PAR] In 1981, Nicholas, his wife and their children were canonized as martyrs by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, located in New York City.  On 15 August 2000  Nicholas and his family were canonized as passion bearers, a title commemorating believers who face death in a Christ-like manner,   by the Russian Orthodox Church within Russia. [PAR] Family background [PAR] Nicholas was born in Alexander Palace, Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, the eldest son of Emperor Alexander III and Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia (formerly Princess Dagmar of Denmark). He had five younger siblings: Alexander (1869\u20131870), George (1871\u20131899), Xenia (1875\u20131960), Michael (1878\u20131918) and Olga (1882\u20131960). Nicholas often referred to his father nostalgically in letters after Alexander's death in 1894. He was also very close to his mother, as revealed in their published letters to each other.  [PAR] His paternal grandparents were Emperor Alexander II and Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia (born Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine). His maternal grandparents were King Christian IX and Queen Louise of Denmark. Nicholas was of primarily German and Danish descent, his last ethnically Russian ancestor being Peter the Great. [PAR] Nicholas was related to several monarchs in Europe. His mother's siblings included Kings Frederik VIII of Denmark and George I of Greece, as well as the United Kingdom's Queen Alexandra (consort of King Edward VII). Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany were all first cousins of King George V of the United Kingdom. Nicholas was also a first cousin of both King Haakon VII and Queen Maud of Norway, as well as King Constantine I of Greece. Nicholas and Wilhelm II were in turn second cousins once removed, as each descended from King Frederick William III of Prussia, as well as third cousins, as they were both great-great-grandsons of Tsar Paul I of Russia. In addition to being second cousins through descent from Louis II, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine and his wife Wilhelmine of Baden, Nicholas and Alexandra were also third cousins once removed, as they were both descendants of King Frederick William II of Prussia.

The overall appearance of the breed is one of grace and agility as well as intelligence and excellent disposition. [PAR] The head of the Irish Setter is rather long with a definite stop between the eyes and the muzzle. The muzzle is very straight and elongated in shape but not tapered or heavy looking. The nose is always wide and black, with wide and noticable openings on the nostrils. They eyes are well set and almond shaped, usually a chestnut or dark hazel color and they are soft and gentle in expression. The ears are very soft and triangular shaped but carried folded over and rather low on the side of the head. The skull is very rounded on top, giving a soft appearance to the head when viewed from the front or the side. The hair on the face is short and very soft, but feathering is noticeable on the ears. [PAR] The neck is somewhat long and graceful looking, sloping into strong and well developed shoulders. The legs are well-boned and muscled but don't appear heavy or over-developed. There is noticeable fringing or furnishings on the front and back legs. The chest is rather narrow yet also deep, ideal for moving though brush or water. The body is longer than the height of the dog at the shoulders. The topline is sloping from the withers to the tail, which is usually carried either down when relaxed or horizontally when the dog is working, happy or moving about. Typically Irish Setters will be very active tail wagers, and their beautiful tail really is a highlight of the breed. [PAR] The coat may be somewhat longer or shorter depending on the breeding and line. Overall field lines or working dogs will have a shorter coat and will be more energetic and athletic than the show lines which are heavier and have a the longer showier coat style. The longer coat is very silky and long with natural waves that add to the depth of the body of the dog. The shorter coat has the same fringes and furnishings as well as the beautiful sheen and wavy, distinctive coat. The hair around the neck, underbelly and chest is slightly longer than the rest of the hair on the body.

The breed has distinctive furnishing on the legs, tail and underbelly that are more pronounced on the longer coated show lines. Field lines may have a much shorter coat but will always have the same coloration. [PAR] History [PAR] The Irish Setter was first developed as a color variation on the original Red and White Setter breed in the 1700's in Ireland and other areas in the United Kingdom. In the 1800's breeders started to select the more solid colored dogs in the Red and White Setter group to develop the all red, solid Irish Setter we know today. Originally the Irish Setter was known as the Irish Red Setter, but this name is no longer used in registries. [PAR] The Irish Setter, prior to 1862, was used strictly as a hunting dog. They have a unique tendency to run in a zigzag pattern in front of the hunter, scanning the area for scents. The Irish Setter was trained to be both a scent dog, a pointing dog and a retriever. This all round hunting combination was extremely popular especially with hunters than were hunting on their own or only had the ability to have one dog with them. [PAR] In 1862 an Irish Red Setter was born that set the standards for the current breed. It was longer, more angular, faster and had a more distinctive face and coat than the other dogs in the breed at the time. This dog, named Champion Palmerston.

[PAR] In the summer of 2010, alterations were made to the Streif, including the introduction of a section from the exit of the Steilhang to the ridge before the Seidlalm that runs parallel to the racecourse but higher up the mountain. This has made it possible to ski next to the Streif during the preparation work in January and during the race weekend. Other key areas are still closed from around January 6th onwards for necessary race preparation but disruption is kept to a minimum.

In turn, the pasture was probably named after a farmer named Brixner \u201cStraiff\u201d. The Mausefalle jump was baptised by Toni Sailer Senior, father of the skiing superstar, because the section in question reminded him of an old wire mousetrap.

There are two distinct cultural traditions of dragons: [PAR] *European dragon, derived from  European folk traditions and ultimately related to Balkans and Western Asian mythologies. Most are depicted as reptilian creatures with animal-level intelligence, are uniqely sexrupeds (i.e. four legs and a detached set of wings). [PAR] *Chinese dragon, with counterparts in Japan (namely the Japanese dragon), Korea and other East Asian and South Asian countries.  Most are depicted as serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence, and are quadrupeds (i.e. four legs and wingless). [PAR] The two traditions may have evolved separately, but have influenced each other to a certain extent, particularly with the cross-cultural contact of recent centuries. The English word dragon and Latin word draco derives from Greek \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd (dr\u00e1k\u014dn), \"dragon, serpent of huge size, water-snake\".  [PAR] Name [PAR] The word dragon entered the English language in the early 13th century from Old French dragon, which in turn comes from Latin draconem (nominative draco) meaning \"huge serpent, dragon\", from the Greek word \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd, drakon (genitive drakontos, \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) \"serpent, giant seafish\". The Greek and Latin term referred to any great serpent, not necessarily mythological, and this usage was also current in English up to the 18th century. [PAR] Morphology [PAR] A dragon is a mythological representation of a reptile. In antiquity, dragons were mostly envisaged as serpents, but since the Middle Ages, it has become common to depict them with legs, resembling a lizard. [PAR] Dragons are usually shown in modern times with a body like a huge lizard, or a snake with two pairs of lizard-type legs, and able to emit fire from their mouths. The European dragon has bat-like wings growing from its back. A dragon-like creature with wings but only a single pair of legs is known as a wyvern. [PAR] Comparative mythology [PAR] The association of the serpent with a monstrous opponent overcome by a heroic deity has its roots in the mythology of the Ancient Near East, including Canaanite (Hebrew, Ugaritic), Hittite and Mesopotamian. Humbaba, the fire-breathing dragon-fanged beast first described in the Epic of Gilgamesh is sometimes described as a dragon with Gilgamesh playing the part of dragon-slayer. The legless serpent (Chaoskampf) motif entered Greek mythology and ultimately Christian mythology, although the serpent motif may already be part of prehistoric Indo-European mythology as well, based on comparative evidence of Indic and Germanic material.  The folk-lore motif of the dragon guarding gold, may have come from earlier Bronze Age customs of introducing serpents to village granaries to deter rats or mice.  [PAR] Although dragons occur in many legends around the world, different cultures have varying stories about monsters that have been grouped together under the dragon label. Some dragons are said to breathe fire or to be poisonous, such as in the Old English poem Beowulf. They are commonly portrayed as serpentine or reptilian, hatching from eggs and possessing typically scaly or feathered bodies. They are sometimes portrayed as hoarding treasure. Some myths portray them with a row of dorsal spines. European dragons are more often winged, while Chinese dragons resemble large snakes. Dragons can have a variable number of legs: none, two, four, or more when it comes to early European literature. [PAR] Dragons are often held to have major spiritual significance in various religions and cultures around the world. In many Asian cultures dragons were, and in some cultures still are, revered as representative of the primal forces of nature, religion and the universe. They are associated with wisdom\u2014often said to be wiser than humans\u2014and longevity. They are commonly said to possess some form of magic or other supernatural power, and are often associated with wells, rain, and rivers.

Wise, the smaller in stature (a disparity in height being the feature of all the finest comedy duos), was the butt of Eric Morecambe's jokes, referred to as the one with the \"short, fat, hairy legs\", and teased about his non- existent toupee with the words \"You can't see the join\". [PAR] It was Wise who opened each show with the greeting, \"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the show\", and revelled in boasting of \"a play wot I wrote\", while Morecambe proceeded to sabotage such literary efforts, determined to knock his supposedly pompous partner down a peg or two. \"What do you think of it so far?\" Morecambe would ask, replying himself, in ventriloquist style, \"Rubbish!\" [PAR] Morecambe and Wise's Christmas shows were consistently ratings-toppers, with audiences of as many as 28 million, and stars queued up to appear on screen with the pair, often only to be sent up. Glenda Jackson performed with Morecambe in a pastiche of a Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers dance routine that finished with the Oscar-winning actress vanishing over the top of a staircase that led nowhere. The newsreader Angela Rippon danced deftly across the screen in an evening dress split to the thigh. The conductor Andre Previn leapt into the air while conducting his symphony orchestra so that Morecambe, playing a Grieg piano concerto rather amateurishly, could see him over the piano lid. Even the former prime minister Harold Wilson appeared in one sketch. [PAR] The list of personalities who joined Morecambe and Wise on screen down the years read like a roll-call of Britain's finest actors and entertainers. The joke was that Wise would grovel to these luminaries while Morecambe treated them with contempt and consistently forgot their names. [PAR] Morecambe and Wise had originally modelled their cross-talk act, combining quickfire gags with visual jokes, on the film giants Abbott and Costello and the more short-lived but hugely popular Wheeler and Woolsey - to whom they bore a remarkable physical resemblance - but their brilliant timing later caused critics to liken them to Laurel and Hardy. In their act, crafted in music halls and variety theatres, Wise was the straight man, on the receiving end of Morecambe's buffoonery and insults, although this one-sidedness gradually changed as greater subtlety and characterisation took over. [PAR] The partnership ended only with Morecambe's death in 1984, which left Wise with the task of rebuilding his career. Although he never reached the same heights as he had with his bespectacled partner, he branched out to work as both a West End stage actor and television game-show panellist. [PAR] He was born Ernest Wiseman in Leeds in 1925, and had his first taste of show business at the age of seven performing in northern working men's clubs alongside his father, a railway porter, in the amateur double act Carson and Kid, later known as Bert Carson and His Little Wonder and, at times, The Two Tetleys, after the local beer. It was a songs-and-gags act but also included the youngster performing a high-speed clog dance. \"The faster I danced, the faster the crowds threw money,\" he later recalled. [PAR] He made his professional debut in January 1939 in the bandleader-turned- impresario Jack Hylton's stage production of the popular BBC radio programme Band Waggon, alongside Arthur Askey and Richard Murdoch, at the Prince's Theatre, London, after being auditioned by a talent-spotter, Bryan Michie, who had tipped off Hylton. Just a couple of weeks after the production opened, the 13-year-old Wiseman was brought in to add a juvenile flavour to the proceedings, earning six pounds a week, three times his father's weekly wage. It was Hylton who changed Wiseman's stage name to Wise. [PAR]\n\n\n### Answer:\nharold wilson </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

This article doesn't yet, but we're working on it! See more info or our list of citable articles . [PAR] Encyclopedia [PAR] From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia [PAR] Pearl Pebbles Slaghoople was a fictional character on the animated TV show The Flintstones . She was the mother of Wilma Pebbles Slaghoople Flintstone , who is married to Fred Flintstone . In the original series, she portrayed Fred's stereotypical antagonistic mother-in-law , acting as a nagging irritant. Her appearance was similar to Wilma's, although Pearl was noticeably heavier, similar in build to the men of Bedrock rather than the more shapely Wilma and Betty . In the original series, she had red hair like Wilma's; in later specials and films, it transitioned to gray. [PAR] It has been stated that Pearl has four children: Jerry, Wilma, and two twin sisters. [PAR] In the first few seasons of The Flintstones, Wilma's maiden name was said to be \"Pebbles\". How Pearl was a Slaghoople, and yet Wilma's maiden name was Pebbles, was never explained. Possibilities include Pearl divorcing Wilma's father, Mr. Pebbles, and later marrying a Mr. Slaghoople, Pearl herself was using her maiden name, Wilma was using her middle name (on account that \"Pebbles\" is easier to say), or that Hanna-Barbera purposefully changed it to avoid confusion with Pebbles Flintstone . Another possibility is that Pearl Slaghoople merely kept her maiden name upon marriage. More logicaly is that Pearl married Mr. Slaghoople after being widowed by Mr. Pebbles (it is stated that Wilma's father has died) and he adopted her daughter, Wilma. Hanna-Barbera, however, merely attributes the discrepancy to a continuity error . Later spinoffs would retroactively assign Wilma's maiden name as \"Slaghoople.\" [PAR] When the series was adapted into live action films, Pearl Slaghoople was played by Elizabeth Taylor in The Flintstones and by Joan Collins in The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas , ironic casting choices due to the large figure of Pearl Slaghoople in the cartoon. [PAR] She also appears in the 1993 animated film The Flintstones Hollyrock -A- Bye Baby, in which she is voiced by Janet Waldo . [PAR] External links[DOC] [TLE] Wilma Flintstone - The Flintstones - WikiaWilma Flintstone | The Flintstones | Fandom powered by Wikia [PAR] Stony Flinstone (adopted son) [PAR] Wilma Flintstone (maiden name Pebble or Slaghoople\u2014see below) is a fictional character in the television animated series The Flintstones . She\u00a0is the beautiful red-headed wife of caveman Fred Flintstone , daughter of Pearl Slaghoople , mother of Pebbles Flintstone and grandmother to Roxy and Chip Rubble. Her best friends were her next door neighbors, Betty and Barney Rubble . [PAR] Wilma's personality was based on that of Alice Kramden , wife of Ralph Kramden on the 1950s television series The Honeymooners . Thus, much like Alice, Wilma played the strong-willed, level-headed person in her marriage, often criticizing Fred for pursuing his various ill-fated schemes. Wilma would also often be the one to bail out Fred when one of his schemes landed him in trouble. [PAR] Contents [PAR] [ show ] [PAR] Fictional character biography [PAR] While the mid-1980s spin-off series The Flintstone Kids depicts Wilma as a child, the series seems to be mostly apocryphal due to its presenting Wilma as a childhood friend of Fred and Barney (the original series asserted that they met as young adults) as well as using the last name Slaghoople instead of the original Pebbles. Still, the series' depictions that Wilma had younger sisters and that her father\u2014who apparently died by the time Wilma reached adulthood\u2014ran a prehistoric computer business might be taken as valid. Wilma did mention having a married sister in the sixth season. [PAR] As a young adult, Wilma worked with Betty as cigarette girls/waitresses at a resort.

The syllables are divided into five pairs called iambs or iambic feet. An iamb is a metrical unit made up of one unstressed syllable followed by one stressed syllable. An example of an iamb would be good BYE. A line of iambic pentameter flows like this: [PAR] baBOOM / baBOOM / baBOOM / baBOOM / baBOOM. [PAR] Here are some examples from the sonnets: [PAR] When I / do COUNT / the CLOCK / that TELLS / the TIME ( Sonnet 12 ) [PAR] When IN / dis GRACE / with FOR / tune AND / men\ufffds EYES [PAR] I ALL / a LONE / be WEEP / my OUT/ cast STATE ( Sonnet 29 ) [PAR] Shall I / com PARE/ thee TO / a SUM / mer's DAY? [PAR] Thou ART / more LOVE / ly AND / more TEM / per ATE ( Sonnet 18 ) [PAR] Shakespeare's plays are also written primarily in iambic pentameter, but the lines are unrhymed and not grouped into stanzas. Unrhymed iambic pentameter is called blank verse . It should be noted that there are also many prose passages in Shakespeare\ufffds plays and some lines of trochaic tetrameter , such as the Witches' speeches in Macbeth . [PAR] Sonnet Structure [PAR] There are fourteen lines in a Shakespearean sonnet. The first twelve lines are divided into three quatrains with four lines each. In the three quatrains the poet establishes a theme or problem and then resolves it in the final two lines, called the couplet. The rhyme scheme of the quatrains is abab cdcd efef. The couplet has the rhyme scheme gg. This sonnet structure is commonly called the English sonnet or the Shakespearean sonnet, to distinguish it from the Italian Petrarchan sonnet form which has two parts: a rhyming octave (abbaabba) and a rhyming sestet (cdcdcd). The Petrarchan sonnet style was extremely popular with Elizabethan sonneteers, much to Shakespeare's disdain (he mocks the conventional and excessive Petrarchan style in Sonnet 130 ). [PAR] Only three of Shakespeare's 154 sonnets do not conform to this structure: Sonnet 99 , which has 15 lines; Sonnet 126 , which has 12 lines; and Sonnet 145 , which is written in iambic tetrameter.

This design was used subsequently by Trans Australia Airlines (later Australian Airlines) as part of its emblem and now features as the centrepiece of the roundel adopted by the Royal Australian Air Force in 1956. It later became part of the insignia of all Australia's Armed Services. [PAR] The kangaroo was painted beneath the cockpit of Qantas' first Liberator aircraft G-AGKT during its conversion at Brisbane's Archerfield airport in October 1944, following Qantas' decision to name its Indian Ocean passage the Kangaroo Service. The symbol featured on all later aircraft. [PAR] The winged kangaroo symbol was created by Sydney designer Gert Sellheim, and first appeared in January 1947 to coincide with Qantas' introduction of Lockheed L749 Constellations. These aircraft began operating on the UK service in December 1947. They were the first Qantas aircraft to carry the Flying Kangaroo and the first to operate right through to London with Qantas crews. The Flying Kangaroo was later placed in a circle. [PAR] In June 1984 Qantas unveiled an updated logo conceived by Tony Lunn of the Lunn Design Group, Sydney. The Flying Kangaroo lost its wings once again and was refined to a more slender, stylised presentation. [PAR] A logo created for the airline's 75th anniversary year was added to all Qantas jet aircraft in 1995. Designed by Ken Cato, it brought together the Flying Kangaroo symbol and the words '75 years' to mark Qantas' contribution to civil aviation.

[PAR] In the more peaceful times following the 1745 Jacobite rebellion, the British Fisheries Society was charged with establishing fishing stations to exploit the local stocks, and hence create employment. The superb natural harbour of Tobermory Bay attracted their attention and construction of a new settlement got under way in 1787-8. The topography dictated the pattern: commercial centre at shore level, with workers\u2019 housing on a terrace above. [PAR] The original layout can still be seen today. Tobermory eventually became more of a general trading port than a notable fishing harbour. The bay today is more likely to be filled with pleasure craft \u2013 a reminder of the importance of tourism to this little island town. Visitor numbers were boosted by the children\u2019s tv programme Balamory, set mostly here. Though filming stopped in 2005, the \u2018Balamory phenomenon\u2019 still has some economic impact. [PAR] Accommodation in Tobermory: [PAR] A choice of accommodation is available in Tobermory and also in beautiful locations in other parts of Mull and also Iona. Guest houses and B&Bs range from a Victorian castle to island farmhouses, and includes establishments on Iona as well as good choice within Tobermory itself. Self catering accommodation is well represented on Mull with a good choice in Tobermory and other communities, as well as farmhouse and estate properties in rural settings. There is a campsite close to Tobermory and a choice of other sites elsewhere on the island. [PAR] Attractions in and around Tobermory\u00a0\u00bb [PAR] A stroll along the waterfront is all that is needed for an idea of some of Tobermory\u2019s attractions. The Isle of Mull Museum is here, with its wide-ranging collections and changing displays on history and archaeology themes. The Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust have a shop and information centre nearby. Tobermory Distillery, which offers tours, is at the south end of the \u2018prom\u2019. An Tobar, the Tobermory Arts Centre, is up the hill behind the harbour.  It is a focus for the promotion of the visual arts, craft and music, throughout the island. [PAR] Activities in and around Tobermory\u00a0\u00bb [PAR] There is a 9-hole course in Tobermory, which is both challenging and has spectacular views. There are several angling lochs close to Tobermory, and the town has an active angling club.  Pony trekking is available within easy reach of Tobermory. As Mull is famous for its wildlife \u2013 both on land and sea \u2013 wildlife watching and wildlife cruises are an important activity. A number of operators offer Mull birdwatching safaris and guided walks, while there is also a choice of seabird, seal and whale-watching cruises operating from Tobermory. [PAR] Whales and dolphins around Mull\u00a0\u00bb [PAR] More than 20 species of cetaceans are regularly sighted in Hebridean waters, including several species of dolphin, as well as minke, humpback and killer whales.  .

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.    [PAR] Early and personal life [PAR] Born in Dartford, 25 June 1932, Kent, he was educated at the Gravesend Technical College school of Art, and the Royal College of Art. [PAR] Blake lives in Chiswick, London. [PAR] Career [PAR] During the late 1950s, Blake became one of the best known British pop artists. His paintings from this time included imagery from advertisements, music hall entertainment, and wrestlers, often including collaged elements. Blake was included in group exhibitions at the Institute of Contemporary Arts and had his first solo exhibition in 1960. In the 'Young Contemporaries' exhibition of 1961 in which he exhibited alongside David Hockney and R.B. Kitaj, he was first identified with the emerging British Pop Art movement. Blake won the (1961) John Moores junior award for Self Portrait with Badges. He came to wider public attention when, along with Pauline Boty, Derek Boshier and Peter Phillips, he featured in Ken Russell's Monitor film on pop art, Pop Goes the Easel, broadcast on BBC television in 1962. From 1963 Blake was represented by Robert Fraser placing him at the centre of swinging London and brought him into contact with leading figures of popular culture. [PAR] Work [PAR] On the Balcony (1955\u201357) is a significant early work which remains an iconic piece of British Pop Art, showing Blake's interest in combining images from pop culture with fine art. The work, which appears to be a collage but is wholly painted, shows, among other things, a boy on the left of the composition holding \u00c9douard Manet's The Balcony, badges and magazines. It was inspired by a painting by Honor\u00e9 Sharrer depicting workers holding famous paintings, Workers and Paintings.  [PAR] Blake has referred to the work of other artists many times. Another example, The First Real Target (1961) a standard archery target with the title written across the top is a play on paintings of targets by Kenneth Noland and Jasper Johns. [PAR] Blake painted several album sleeves. He designed the sleeve for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band with his wife Jann Haworth, the American-born artist whom he married in 1963 and divorced in 1979. The Sgt. Pepper's sleeve has become an iconic work of pop art, much imitated and Blake's best-known work. Producing the collage necessitated the construction of a set with cut-out photographs and objects, such as flowers, centred on a drum (sold in auction in 2008) with the title of the album. Blake has subsequently complained about the one-off fee he received for the design (\u00a3200  ), with no subsequent royalties. Blake made sleeves for the Band Aid single, \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" (1984), Paul Weller's Stanley Road (1995) and the Ian Dury tribute album Brand New Boots and Panties (2001; Blake was Dury's tutor at the Royal College of Art in the mid-60s). He designed the sleeves for Pentangle's Sweet Child and The Who's Face Dances (1981), which features portraits of the band by a number of artists. [PAR] In 1969, Blake left London to live near Bath. His work changed direction to feature scenes based on English Folklore and characters from Shakespeare. In the early 1970s, he made a set of watercolour paintings to illustrate Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass using a young artist, Celia Wanless, as the model for Alice and in 1975 he was a founder of the Brotherhood of Ruralists. Blake moved back to London in 1979 and his work returned to earlier popular culture references. [PAR] In 1990 and 1991, Blake painted the artwork to Eric Clapton's 1991 million-selling live album 24 Nights. A scrapbook featuring all of Blake's drawing was later released. [PAR] In January 1992, Blake appeared on BBC2's acclaimed \"Arena\" Masters of the Canvas documentary and painted the portrait of the wrestler Kendo Nagasaki.

Connecticut is also often grouped along with New York and New Jersey as the Tri-State area. It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south. Its capital city is Hartford, and its most populous city is Bridgeport. The state is named after the Connecticut River, a major U.S. river that approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an Algonquian word for \"long tidal river\".  [PAR] Connecticut is the third smallest state by area,  the 29th most populous,  and the fourth most densely populated of the 50 United States. It is known as the \"Constitution State\", the \"Nutmeg State\", the \"Provisions State\", and the \"Land of Steady Habits\". It was influential in the development of the federal government of the United States. Much of southern and western Connecticut (along with the majority of the state's population) is part of the New York metropolitan area: three of Connecticut's eight counties are statistically included in the New York City combined statistical area, which is widely referred to as the Tri-State area. Connecticut's center of population is in Cheshire, New Haven County, which is also located within the Tri-State area. [PAR] Connecticut's first European settlers were Dutch. They established a small, short-lived settlement in present-day Hartford at the confluence of the Park and Connecticut rivers, called Huys de Goede Hoop. Initially, half of Connecticut was a part of the Dutch colony, New Netherland, which included much of the land between the Connecticut and Delaware rivers. The first major settlements were established in the 1630s by England. Thomas Hooker led a band of followers overland from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded what would become the Connecticut Colony; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the Saybrook Colony and the New Haven Colony. The Connecticut and New Haven Colonies established documents of Fundamental Orders, considered the first constitutions in North America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a crown colony. This colony was one of the Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution. [PAR] The Connecticut River, Thames River, and ports along the Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong maritime tradition, which continues today. The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in Fairfield County. As of the 2010 Census, Connecticut features the highest per-capita income, Human Development Index (0.962), and median household income in the United States.    [PAR] Geography [PAR] Connecticut is bordered on the south by Long Island Sound, on the west by New York, on the north by Massachusetts, and on the east by Rhode Island. The state capital and third largest city is Hartford, and other major cities and towns (by population) include Bridgeport, New Haven, Stamford, Waterbury, Norwalk, Danbury, New Britain, Greenwich and Bristol. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of Montenegro. There are 169 incorporated towns in Connecticut. [PAR] The highest peak in Connecticut is Bear Mountain in Salisbury in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York meet (42\u00b0 3' N; 73\u00b0 29' W), on the southern slope of Mount Frissell, whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.  At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet above sea level. [PAR] Although Connecticut has a long maritime history, and a reputation based on that history, Connecticut has no direct oceanfront. The coast of Connecticut sits on Long Island Sound, and estuary.

He was the son of an upper-class burgeois family and attended the best schools, becoming a lawyer in 1651. After being a lawyer for some time, he was appointed chief clerk in the king's building, superintendent's office in 1664. While there, he induced Colbert to establish a fund called Liste des Bienfaits du Roi, to give pensions to writers and savants not only in France but in Europe. He took part in the creation of the Academy of Sciences as well as the restoration of the Academy of Painting. When the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres was founded by Colbert in 1663, Perrault was made secretary for life. Having written but a few popular poems, he was elected to the French Academy in 1671, and on the day of his inauguration he invited the public to be admitted to the meeting, a privilege that has ever since been continued. Perrault laid the foundations for a new literary genre, the fairy tale, with his works derived from pre-existing folk tales. The best known of his tales include Le Petit Chaperon rouge (Little Red Riding Hood), Cendrillon (Cinderella), Le Chat Bott\ufffd (Puss in Boots), La Belle au bois dormant (The Sleeping Beauty) and La Barbe bleue (Bluebeard). His stories continue to be printed and have been adapted to opera, ballet (for example, Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty), theatre, and film. He also wrote Parall\ufffdles des Anciens et des Modernes (the Parallels between the Ancients and the Moderns), from 1688 to 1697, which compared the authors of antiquity unfavorably to more modern writers, and caused a debate that lasted for years. Charles Perrault died on May 16, 1703. [PAR] Although now best known for his stained glass work, Harry Clarke (1889-1931) first found fame as a book illustrator. His edition of The Fairy Tales of Hans Christian Andersen was followed by illustrated editions of Edgar Allan Poe's Tales of Mystery and Imagination, The Years at the Spring, Charles Perrault's Fairy Tales of Perrault, and Goethe's Faust.

Tears formed through crying are associated with strong internal emotions, such as sorrow, elation, emotion, love, awe or pleasure.  Laughing or yawning may also lead to the production of tears. [PAR] Physiology [PAR] In humans, the tear film coating the eye, known as the precorneal film, has three distinct layers, from the most outer surface:  [PAR] Having a thin tear film may prevent one's ability to wear contact lenses, as the amount of oxygen needed is higher than normal, and contact lenses stop oxygen from entering the eye. Eyes with thin tear film will dry out while wearing contact lenses. Special eye drops are available for contact lens wearers. Certain types of contact lenses are designed to let more oxygen through to the eye. [PAR] Drainage of tear film [PAR] The lacrimal glands secrete lacrimal fluid, which flows through the main excretory ducts into the space between the eyeball and lids.  When the eyes blink, the lacrimal fluid is spread across the surface of the eye.  Lacrimal fluid gathers in the lacrimal lake, and is drawn into the puncta by capillary action, then flows through the lacrimal canaliculi at the inner corner of the eyelids entering the lacrimal sac, then on to the nasolacrimal duct, and finally into the nasal cavity.  An excess of tears, as with strong emotion, can thus cause the nose to run. [PAR] [http://www.academy.org.uk/tutorials/dilate3.jpg] [PAR] Types [PAR] There are three very basic types of tears: [PAR] Neural aspects [PAR] The trigeminal V1 (fifth cranial) nerve bears the sensory pathway of the tear reflexes.  When the trigeminal nerve is cut, tears from reflexes will stop, but not emotional tears.  Likewise, application of cocaine to the surface of the eye, due to its paralyzing effect on the sensory nerve endings, inhibits the reflex even under exposure to strong tear gases.  The motor pathway is autonomic (involuntary), and, in general, uses the pathway of the facial (seventh) nerve in the parasympathetic division.  In parasympathetic imitators (such as acetylcholine), more tears are produced, and an anticholinergic drug like atropine inhibits tear production.  A newborn infant has insufficient development of nervous control, so s/he \"cries without weeping.\"  If the lacrimal gland malfunctions or is damaged (e.g. by surgery), but does not cause any severe drying of the cornea, it is not a serious matter, for the accessory glands are enough for general secretion.  In reflex situations, copious tears are produced mainly in emergencies. [PAR] Diseases and disorders [PAR] Quality of vision is affected by the stability of the tear film.  [PAR] \"Crocodile tears syndrome\", also known as Bogorad's syndrome, is an uncommon consequence of nerve regeneration subsequent to Bell's palsy or other damage to the facial nerve in which efferent fibers from the superior salivary nucleus become improperly connected to nerve axons projecting to the lacrimal glands, causing one to shed tears (lacrimate) during salivation while smelling foods or eating. It is presumed that one would also salivate while crying due to the inverse improper connection of the lacrimal nucleus to the salivary glands, but this would be less noticeable.   [PAR] Keratoconjunctivitis sicca, known as dry eye, is a very common disorder of the tear film.  However, sufferers can experience watering of the eyes, which is in fact a response to irritation caused by the original tear film deficiency. Lack of Meibomian gland secretion can mean the tears are not enveloped in a hydrophobic film coat, leading to tears spilling onto the face. [PAR] Familial dysautonomia is a genetic condition that can be associated with a lack of overflow tears (alacrima) during emotional crying.  [PAR] Obstruction of the punctum, nasolacrimal canal, or nasolacrimal duct can cause even normal levels of basal tear to overflow onto the face (epiphora), giving the appearance of constant psychic tearing. This can have significant social consequences.

Unlike the other islands in French Polynesia, there are no lagoons or protected coral reefs surrounding these landscapes. Instead, steep volcanic mountains plunge straight into the pounding Pacific Ocean, while jagged ridges lay interspersed between deep valleys and thriving jungles. [PAR] ARCHIPELAGO:[DOC] [TLE] Melville's Mysterious Marquesas Then And NowMelville's Mysterious Marquesas Then And Now | The Huffington Post [PAR] Melville's Mysterious Marquesas Then And Now [PAR] 07/02/2012 07:24 am ET | Updated Sep 01, 2012 [PAR] Lorie Karnath 37th President, The Explorers Club [PAR] Despite being one of the most remote archipelagoes on the planet, the rugged Marquesas Islands have attracted more than their fair share of luminaries. The far-flung Marquesas are comprised of a group of 14 islands in the southern Pacific Ocean, part of French Polynesia. Located at 9\u00b0 00S, 139\u00b0 30W, the islands lie just under 1400 km northeast of Tahiti and approximately 4800 km from Mexico's west coast, the closest continental land mass.  The islands' native name \"Henua Enata\" means \"The Land of Men\", and these are distributed between a northern grouping E\u00efao, Hatutu (Hatutaa), Motu One, together with the islands centered around the large island of Nuku Hiva and a southern one clustered around the main island of Hiva `Oa . With a combined land mass of about 1049 km squared, all are of volcanic origin except for Motu One. [PAR] Over the centuries the Marquesas' allure has proven particularly compelling to adventurers, artists, musicians and writers. [PAR] In 1841 Herman Melville sailed from Massachusetts aboard the whaler Acushnet, on an 18 month journey which later served as the template for his classic whaling tale Moby-Dick. Upon reaching the Marquesas, Melville's first perusal of the island's striking coastline, dramatically punctuated by spectacular spiraling peaks that appeared to vanish amongst the clouds, enthralled him. Once ashore, the islands copious vegetation, including a plethora of tropical fruits, cascading waterfalls, perpendicular cliffs and tumultuous streams further inspired the writer. So much so, in fact, that he abruptly abandoned ship. Having done this Melville voluntarily took up residence amongst the Typee natives, who were, at the time, considered to have a proclivity towards cannibalism. The sojourn inspired the author's book named after these indigenous people, which captured the public's imagination and served for many as an initial personification of primitive cultures. [PAR] Other authors, including Robert Louis Stevenson and Jack London, would also fall under the islands' captivating spell. The post-impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, a key figure in the development of modern art, spent his latter years furthering his mastery of flat congruent color planes influenced by the tropical palette that he discovered on the Marquesas. The Belgian singer Jacques Brel also spent time there and was later buried on the main island of Hiva Oa, not far from Gauguin's final resting place. [PAR] The population of the isolated islands is approximated hovers around 9000 although it is estimated that it was once more than ten times this number. The drastic reduction was triggered by diseases carried by the early western explorers, further aggravated by subsequent slave trade, cultural genocide and war. Documentation indicates that the islands were first settled by the Polynesians most likely from Samoa and Tonga, these are supposed to have reached the region sometime before 100 AD. A visit to the Marquesas today reveals a land full of enchantments and much unchanged from earlier times. The Marquesan people have stayed true to their distinctive history cultures and customs. These friendly and hospitable people embrace the future with an eye towards accommodating the spirits of their ancient past. [PAR] A few roads have been built or are under construction and some of the main villages even boast a handful of street lamps, however the majority of the islands' topography remains untamed. The best way to discover the many secluded beaches is via sailboat. To access much of the mountainous regions and luxuriantly vegetated valleys, or best penetrate the islands' thick forests, often requires a journey by foot or horseback.

[PAR] Richard Attenborough's ambitious 1987 epic, Cry Freedom, is seen as an overview of conditions in South Africa at the height of apartheid.

[PAR] The movie divided South Africa commentators.

[PAR] Uploaded on Jan 24, 2012 [PAR] Dancing with the Stars is the name of several international television series based on the format of the British TV series Strictly Come Dancing, which is distributed by BBC Worldwide -- the commercial arm of the BBC. Currently the format has been licensed to over 35 countries (as of September 2011).[1] Australia was the first country to adapt the show, and versions have also been produced in Albania, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, United States, and Vietnam. As a result, the series became the world's most popular television program among all genres in 2006 and 2007, according to the magazine Television Business International,[2] reaching the Top 10 in 17 countries. The show pairs a number of celebrities with professional ballroom dancers, who each week compete by performing dances. The dancers are then scored by a panel of judges. Viewers are given a certain amount of time to place votes for their favorite dancers, either by telephone or (in some countries) online. The couple with the lowest combined score provided by the judges and viewers is eliminated. This process continues until there are only two or three couples left; when they have competed for the last time one couple is declared the champion. [PAR] Professionals achieving three wins [PAR] Derek Hough, Raimondo Todaro and Kym Johnson are the only professionals in the history of the franchise to have achieved three championship wins.     Derek Hough won his first championship in season seven of the American version of Dancing With the Stars with model/host Brooke Burke, his second in season ten with singer Nicole Scherzinger, and his third in season eleven with actress Jennifer Grey. Raimondo Todaro won his first championship in the Italian version of Dancing with the Stars called Ballando con le stelle with the former Miss Italy and television hostess, Cristina Chiabotto, during the second season of the show. He won again with the Olympic long-jump silver medalist, Fiona May, during the third season of the show. Four years later, Todaro won the sixth season of the show with the actress, Veronica Olivier.     Kym Johnson is the only professional dancer to have won three championships from two different versions of Dancing with the Stars.

By the 1870s a wide variety of birth control devices were available in English and American pharmacies, including rubber condoms and diaphragms, chemical suppositories, vaginal sponges, and medicated tampons. Easy public access to contraceptive devices in the United States aroused the ire of Anthony Comstock and others, who lobbied Congress until it passed (1873) a bill prohibiting the distribution of these devices across state lines or through the mail. Moreover, in England in 1877, Annie Besant and Charles Bradlaugh were tried for selling The Fruits of Philosophy, a pamphlet on contraceptive methods, written in 1832 by an American, Charles Knowlton. After their famous trial, the Malthusian League was founded. Meanwhile, a variety of contraceptive devices remained available to a large public, usually advertised in veiled but unmistakable language. [PAR] In 1878 the first birth control clinic was founded in Amsterdam by Aletta Jacobs. The first U.S. birth control clinic, opened (1916) by Margaret Sanger in Brooklyn, N.Y., was closed by the police; she received a 30-day jail sentence. She later permanently established a clinic in New York City in 1923. In Great Britain the Malthusian League, aided by Marie Stopes , established a birth control clinic in London in 1921. [PAR] Sanger also helped organize (1917) the National Birth Control League in the United States; in 1921 it became the American Birth Control League, and in 1942 the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Meanwhile, in 1918 an American judge ruled that contraceptive devices were legal as instruments for the prevention of disease, and the federal law prohibiting dissemination of contraceptive information through the mails was modified in 1936. Throughout the 1940s and 50s, birth control advocates were engaged in numerous legal suits. In 1965 the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the one remaining state law (in Connecticut) prohibiting the use of contraceptives. [PAR] The federal government began to take a more active part in the birth control movement in 1967, when 6% of the funds allotted to the Child Health Act was set aside for family planning; in 1970, the Family Planning Services and Population Act established separate funds for birth control. Birth control and sex education in schools continue to be emotional issues in the United States, where adolescent sexual activity and pregnancy rates are high and bring with them increased risks of sexually transmitted diseases and complications of pregnancy, as well as societal and personal costs. [PAR] Birth control on the international level is led by the International Planned Parenthood Federation, founded in 1952, with members in 134 countries by 1995. Sweden was one of the first countries to provide government assistance for birth control, which it did as early as the 1930s. Two of the more successful birth control programs have been in Japan, where the birthrate has been dramatically reduced, and\u2014more controversially\u2014in China, where the government has a \"one family, one child\" policy and local authorities have typically intimated women pregnant into aborting a second pregnancy. Several of the so-called underpopulated nations, however, have a stated policy of encouraging an increased birthrate, e.g., Argentina, and concern over declining populations has increased in recent years in certain Western European countries and Russia. Among religious bodies, the Roman Catholic Church has provided the main opposition to the birth control movement; popes Paul VI and John Paul II reaffirmed this stance in encyclicals.

The mountain lies completely within Argentina and, unlike many other Andean peaks, does not sit on the international border with Chile . [PAR] Highest Mountain in the Andes [PAR] Aconcagua is the highest point in the Andes , the world's longest mountain range. The Andes, beginning in northern South America and ending at the continent's tip, stretch over 4,300 miles (7,000 kilometers) in a narrow band along the west edge of South America. The Andes pass through seven countries-- Columbia , Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina , and Chile . [PAR] How Did Aconcagua Form? [PAR] Aconcagua is not a volcano. The mountain was formed by the collision of the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate during the relatively recent Andean orogeny or period of mountain building. The Nazca Plate, the ocean crust to the west, is being subducted or pushed beneath the South American Plate, forming the long chain of the Andes. [PAR] 1897: First Known Ascent [PAR] The first known ascent of Aconcagua was during an expedition led by Edward Fitz Gerald in the summer of 1897. Swiss climber Mathias Zurbriggen reached the summit alone on January 14 via today's Normal Route. A few days later Nicholas Lanti and Stuart Vines made the second ascent. These were the highest ascents in the world at that time. [PAR] Did the Incas Climb Aconcagua? [PAR] It is possible that the mountain had previously been climbed by Pre-Columbian Incans . The skeleton of a guanaco was found on the summit ridge and in 1985 a well-preserved mummy was found at 17,060 feet (5,200 meters) on the southwest ridge of Cerro Pyramidal, an Aconcagua sub-peak.

He could not raise him himself, and brings him to a family of wolves who just had puppies. The mother agrees to raise him but Bagheera was unsure if the father, Rama would. Rama sees the baby smile and agrees to raise him as his own pup. Bagheera helped raise Mowgli, taking him to the jungle and learning about it. Mowgli considered himself a wolf of the jungle but Bagheera knew that she would have to follow the ways of man someday. That day came when the wolf pack learned that Shere Khan, the tiger had returned and if he learns of Mowgli being in the jungle, he would kill him. Rama had no choice but to let him go but Bagheera suggested he'd be taken to a man-village and volunteered to take him there. [PAR] Of course, Mowgli did not want to go but Bagheera was determined to bring him there. They encountered Kaa the python and Colonel Hathi and his band of elephants along the way and almost got killed by them. After several failed attempts to get Mowgli to leave, Bagheera gave up and left him. Mowgli met Baloo and the two became best friends very quickly. Bagheera didn't approve the friendship but did not see any harm to it. When Mowgli gets captured by King Louie and his monkeys, Baloo and Bagheera go and rescue him but got injured in the process. [PAR] Later that night, while Mowgli slept, Baloo and Bagheera talked it out about the current situation. Baloo believes Mowgli will be fine in the jungle but Bagheera reminds him of Shere Khan's return and Baloo knew that the tiger would not rest until Mowgli was dead. Bagheera asks Baloo to persuade Mowgli to go to the village to which he hesitantly agrees. When he suggests to Mowgli that he should go, Mowgli became furious and runs off, leading the two animals to search for him. [PAR] Bagheera heard Colonel Hathi nearby and asked for his help. Hathi had no recollection of Mowgli and the panther had to remind him again. Unbeknownst to Bagheera, Shere Khan was nearby overhearing the conversation and began to search for Mowgli himself. Hathi refused to search for the man-cub but his wife, Winifred threatened to overthrow him if he does not help find him. For the sake of his own son, Hathi agrees and splits his herd into small groups and had them search all over. [PAR] Shere Khan found Mowgli but so did Baloo and Baloo tried to keep the tiger away from Mowgli. Shere Khan had the upper hand and injured Baloo. Mowgli found a branch caught on fire and scared Shere Khan away with it. When Bagheera arrived, she found Mowgli distraught over Baloo's death. She gives a powerful and touching eulogy about Baloo and leaves his body be. Baloo was not dead and asks Bagheera to continue talking about him, which angers Bagheera. Mowgli sees a girl nearby, falls in love with her and follows her into the man-village. Bagheera was glad that Mowgli went to the village and Baloo was sad.

[PAR] How does solar electric propulsion        (ion propulsion) work? [PAR] What is an ion? [PAR] An ion is a charged atom or molecule. It is charged because the number of electrons    do not equal the number of protons in the atom or molecule. An atom can acquire    a positive charge or a negative charge depending on whether the number of electrons    in an atom is greater or less then the number of protons in the atom. [PAR] When an atom is attracted to another atom because it has an unequal number    of electrons and protons, the atom is called an ION. If the atom has more electrons    than protons, it is a negative ion, or ANION. If it has more protons than electrons,it    is a positive ion.[DOC] [TLE] What are positively charged ions called? | Reference.comWhat are positively charged ions called? | Reference.com [PAR] What are positively charged ions called? [PAR] A: [PAR] Quick Answer [PAR] Positively charged ions are called cations. Ions with positive charges have donated the electrons in their outermost shells to electronegative atoms that tend to attract electrons. [PAR] Full Answer [PAR] Cations have a positive charge because they are electron donors. These atoms have few electrons in their outermost shell and don't hold on to them well. Atoms have a tendency to fill their outermost shells with the goal of having the full complement of eight electrons in these shells: This is the most stable electron arrangement. To get this stable arrangement, certain atoms give away electrons and some collect them. When an atom loses electrons, the number of protons in the nucleus no longer balances the number of electrons. The net charge on the atom is now positive, and the atom becomes a cation.[DOC] [TLE] ion: Positive and Negative Electric Charges - Infopleaseion: Positive and Negative Electric Charges [PAR] ion [PAR] Positive and Negative Electric Charges [PAR] A neutral atom or group of atoms becomes an ion by gaining or losing one or more electrons or protons. Since the electron and proton have equal but opposite unit charges, the charge of an ion is always expressed as a whole number of unit charges and is either positive or negative. A simple ion consists of only one charged atom; a complex ion consists of an aggregate of atoms with a net charge. If an atom or group loses electrons or gains protons, it will have a net positive charge and is called a cation . If an atom or group gains electrons or loses protons, it will have a net negative charge and is called an anion . [PAR] Since ordinary matter is electrically neutral, ions normally exist as groups of cations and anions such that the sum total of positive and negative charges is zero. In common table salt, or sodium chloride, NaCl, the sodium cations, Na+, are neutralized by chlorine anions, Cl - . In the salt sodium carbonate, Na2CO3, two sodium cations are needed to neutralize each carbonate anion, CO3 - 2, because its charge is twice that of the sodium ion. [PAR] Sections in this article:[DOC] [TLE] What are negatively charged ions called? | Reference.comWhat are negatively charged ions called? | Reference.com [PAR] What are negatively charged ions called? [PAR] A: [PAR] Quick Answer [PAR] Negatively charged ions are called anions. Atoms that are high on the electronegativity scale, such as fluorine and oxygen, become anions by gaining electrons. Highly electronegative atoms strongly attract electrons, thus attaining eight electrons in their outer energy levels and creating a more stable atom. [PAR] Full Answer [PAR] Atoms in their natural states are neutral, meaning they have the same numbers of protons and electrons. Protons have a positive charge, and electrons have a negative charge. In a neutral atom, the number of negative charges in the energy levels balances the number of positive charges in the nucleus. [PAR] The octet rule governs the activity of atoms. Atoms can become more stable by achieving full outer energy levels like the elements called the noble gases.

Tolkien Born 120 Years Ago On January 3, 1892 [PAR] Wolff Bachner [PAR] One hundred and twenty years ago today, in a quiet village in South Africa, one of the modern era\u2019s most beloved authors was born. January 3, 1892 marks the date of birth of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, adored by readers and film lovers the world over as the creator of The Lord Of The Rings and The Hobbit, two of the most successful and widely read books in history. [PAR] According to recently updated figures , The Lord Of The Rings is the best selling work of fiction of all time with 300 million copies in print. The Hobbit follows close behind in second place on the all time best seller list with 250 million copies in print. One author, who lived far from the hustle and bustle of modern life, working quietly in long hand or on a manual typewriter in the dark hours of the night, wrote two novels that sold more than 550 million copies. His work has been translated into almost every known language and well read copies are found on the bookshelves of almost every library on the planet. [PAR] The Tolkien Classics: [PAR] Tolkien wrote The Hobbit as a children\u2019s story, originally intended to amuse his own growing brood, who were treated to exciting readings of each new chapter by a doting father. Tolkien was always somewhat mystified by the book\u2019s popularity and the tale certainly takes a less profound tone than his later works. It is wonderful to imagine a smiling Father Tolkien reading The Hobbit to his four attentive children, speaking in the voice of Gandalf, Bilbo, Smaug, Thorin Oakenshield or Gollum. [PAR] The Lord Of The Rings grew out of Tolkien\u2019s immense imagined world, which he referred to as his Legendarium, a word Tolkien created from slightly obscure Latin roots to describe the universe in which his characters existed. The foundation of his legendarium goes back to the earliest days of Tolkien\u2019s career, covering a span of 60 years of work and many thousands of pages. His body of fiction includes The Lord Of The Rings, The Hobbit, The Silmarillion, and more than a dozen other books that explore the high fantasy world of Middle Earth. [PAR] The Life Of An Oxford Don: [PAR] While writing popular best sellers is certainly a noteworthy accomplishment and writing the most popular work of fiction in human history is astounding, the achievements of J.R.R. Tolkien are made all the more amazing by the sum of his life and his work. Tolkien was much more than the author of successful books that were made into Academy Award winning movies grossing more than three billion dollars. He was a young patriot who fought for his country in World War One and he was a devoted husband and a loving father. Tolkien was the favorite, pipe smoking professor of several generations of young English university students and one of the world\u2019s great teachers of ancient Anglo Saxon literature. [PAR] Academics the world over considered J.R.R Tolkien one of the greatest philologists and experts on myth and legend who ever lived. Tolkien was a renowned university professor who held the two most important chairs in Anglo Saxon Studies; The Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Pembroke College, Oxford , from 1925 to 1945 and the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature at Merton College, Oxford from 1945 to 1959. [PAR] Although he is far better known for the high fantasy world of Middle Earth, Tolkien\u2019s work on the heroic epic poem Beowulf is considered one of the crowing achievements in the study of Old English legend and mythology. Tolkien\u2019s ground breaking 1936 lecture, Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics , famously discounted the historical roots of Beowulf. Tolkien insisted the poem \u201cis in fact so interesting as poetry, in places poetry so powerful, that this quite overshadows the historical content.\u201d Recently, more than 2000 precious pages of Tolkien\u2019s handwritten translation of Beowulf and his commentary were found in the archives of the Bodleian Library at Oxford University.

This force is about 50% greater than the person's body weight. During a typical day, people spend about 4 hours on their feet and take 8,000 - 10,000 steps. This means that the feet support a combined force equivalent to several hundred tons every day. [PAR] Foot Problems and Their Locations [PAR] Foot pain generally starts in one of three places: the toes, the forefoot, or the hindfoot. [PAR] The Toes. Toe problems most often occur because of the pressure imposed by ill-fitting shoes. [PAR] The Forefoot. The forefoot is the front of the foot. Pain originating here usually involves one of the following bone groups: [PAR] The metatarsal bones (five long bones that extend from the front of the arch to the bones in the toe) [PAR] The sesamoid bones (two small bones embedded at the top of the first metatarsal bone, which connects to the big toe) [PAR] The Hindfoot. The hindfoot is the back of the foot. Pain originating here can extend from the heel, across the sole (known as the plantar surface), to the ball of the foot (the metatarsophalangeal joint). [PAR] Summary of Foot Problems [PAR] In-Depth From A.D.A.M. Causes [PAR] Nearly all causes of foot pain can be grouped under one of the following: [PAR] Ill-fitting shoes. Poorly fitting shoes are a frequent cause of foot pain. High-heeled shoes concentrate pressure on the toes and can aggravate, if not cause, problems with the toes. [PAR] Certain medical conditions. Any medical condition that causes a disturbance in the way a person walks can contribute to foot pain. This may include diseases or conditions that lead to pain or numbness in the feet (such as diabetes), leg and foot deformities, spinal problems, and neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease or cerebral palsy. [PAR] High-impact exercise. High-impact exercising, such as jogging or strenuous aerobics, can injure the feet and other parts of the leg. Common injuries include corns, calluses, blisters, muscle cramps, acute knee and ankle injuries, plantar fasciitis, and metatarsalgia. [PAR] Medical Conditions Causing Foot Pain [PAR] Arthritic Conditions. Arthritic conditions, particularly osteoarthritis and gout, can cause foot pain. Although rheumatoid arthritis almost always develops in the hand, the ball of the foot can also be affected. [PAR] Diabetes. Diabetes is an important cause of serious foot disorders. [PAR] Obesity. Obesity can cause foot and ankle pain. [PAR] Pregnancy. Pregnancy can cause fluid buildup and swollen feet. The increased weight and imbalance of pregnancy contributes to foot stress. [PAR] Medications. Some medications, such as calcitonin and drugs used for high blood pressure, can cause foot swelling. [PAR] Click the icon to see an image of foot inspection. [PAR] In-Depth From A.D.A.M. Risk Factors [PAR] A risk factor is anything that increases your chances of getting a disease or condition. The following are factors that increase your risk for foot pain: [PAR] Age [PAR] Elderly people are at very high risk for foot problems. As you age, your feet widen and flatten, and the fat padding on the sole of the foot wears down. The skin on the feet also becomes dryer. Foot pain in older adults may be the first sign of age-related conditions, such as arthritis, diabetes, and circulatory disease. Foot problems can also impair balance and function in this age group. [PAR] Cosmetic Foot Surgery [PAR] Taking fashion to extreme limits, some people have turned to cosmetic surgery as a drastic way to fit into high-heeled shoes. Procedures include surgical shortening of the toes, narrowing of feet, or injecting silicone into the pads of the feet. Such methods may increase your risk for future foot pain.

[PAR] The plane was commandeered by militiamen from Hezbolla and Islamic Jihad, armed with grenades and pistols. The purloined 727 then embarked on an incredible, 17-day odyssey to Lebanon, Algeria, and back again. [PAR] Save for the September 11th attacks, the story of flight 847 stands as the single-most dramatic and unforgettable airliner hijacking in history. Yet most of us have forgotten about it. Younger people have likely never heard of it. Which is why I\u2019m bringing up the anniversary: for the sake of perspective. Our politics and culture have become preoccupied with the specter of terrorism, an obsession that is felt acutely by those of us on the front lines of commercial air travel. Yet ironically, whether because or in spite of this fixation, attacks against civil aviation targets don\u2019t happen nearly as often as they used to. Few people know or recall how deadly previous decades were. The 1970s and 1980s in particular were rife with hijackings, bombings, airport shootings and so on. [PAR] Maybe this is healthy, to some extent?  We can view it, perhaps, as an expression of resilience, a cultural acknowledgment that hey, we all face certain risks, and even the most calamitous front-page tragedies eventually give way to the march of time as people go on living their lives. At the other extreme, we can see it as ignorant, or even dangerous: valuable historical context obliterated by an age of hysterical news coverage and a general hypersensitivity to pretty much everything. [PAR] I don\u2019t know which of those, if either, is a correct diagnosis, but try to envision, for a moment, the flight 847 saga happening today. Imagine, if you possibly can, how berserk the media would be. Mind you, flight 847 was the third hijacking to occur in the region that week in 1985! Earlier, a Jordanian 707 and a Middle East Airlines 707 had been taken. Those first two had been dramatic enough, but this was a hijacking that the boldest Hollywood script couldn\u2019t have improved upon: A U.S. Navy diver named Robert Stethem would be murdered and his body tossed onto the tarmac. Other passengers and crew were beaten multiple times. Passengers were removed, split into groups, and held captive in downtown Beirut, including a group of Jewish passengers eventually freed by U.S. Delta Force soldiers. At the airport in Algiers, one of the flight attendants charged 6000 gallons of jet fuel to her personal credit card after Algerian officials refused to provide fuel without payment. On its third landing in Beirut, the jet nearly ran out of fuel and crashed. And so on. The photograph of TWA captain John Testrake, his head out the cockpit window, collared by a gun-wielding terrorist, was broadcast worldwide and became an icon of the siege. [PAR] Remarkably, Robert Stethem would be the only fatality. The remaining crew and passengers were eventually let go. The Israeli government later released 700 Shiite prisoners. Though this had been among the hijackers demands, Israel denied any connection.

He stayed at the Shaolin Monastery and preached Buddhist ideologies. At that time he supposedly trained the local people in the art of Varmakkalai. [PAR] History of Bodhidharma [PAR] Bodhidharma was a Buddhist monk who lived during the 5th/6th century and is traditionally credited as the leading patriarch and transmitter of Zen (Chinese: Ch\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdn, Sanskrit: Dhyana) to China. According to Chinese legend, he also began the physical training of the Shaolin monks that led to the creation of Shaolinquan. However, martial arts historians have shown this legend stems from a 17th century qigong manual known as the Yijin Jing. [PAR] Little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and subsequent accounts became layered with legend, but many accounts state that he was from a Brahmin family in southern India and possibly of royal lineage. Scholars have concluded his place of birth to be Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu. [PAR] After becoming a Buddhist monk, Bodhidharma traveled to China. The accounts differ on the date of his arrival, with one early account claiming that he arrived during the Li\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd S\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdng Dynasty (420-479) and later accounts dating his arrival to the Li\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdng Dynasty (502-557). Bodhidharma was primarily active in the lands of the Northern W\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdi Dynasty (386-534). Modern scholarship dates him to about the early 5th century. [PAR] Throughout Buddhist art, Bodhidharma is depicted as a rather ill-tempered, profusely bearded and wide-eyed barbarian. He is described as \"The Blue-Eyed Barbarian\" in Chinese texts. The Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall (952) identifies Bodhidharma as the 28th Patriarch of Buddhism in an uninterrupted line that extends all the way back to the Buddha himself. D.T. Suzuki contends that Ch\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdn's growth in popularity during the 7th and 8th centuries attracted criticism that it had \"no authorized records of its direct transmission from the founder of Buddhism\" and that Ch\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdn historians made Bodhidharma the 28th patriarch of Buddhism in response to such attacks [PAR] Research Notes [PAR] The earliest historical record of Bodhidharma was compiled in 547 by Yang Xuanzhi, the Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang, in which Yang identifies Bodhidharma as a Persian Central Asian (Wade-Giles: po-szu kuo hu-jen) (Broughton, 1999, p. 54, p.138). [PAR] However, Broughton notes that Y\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdng may have actually been referring to another monk named Boddhidharma, not related to the historical founder of Chan Buddhism.

Peter Ustinov and Aldo Ray were two, but who played the third?\n\n### Context:\n[DOC] [TLE] We're No Angels (1955) - Turner Classic MoviesWe're No Angels (1955) [PAR] Remind Me [PAR] We're No Angels (1955) [PAR] In 1955, two key talents of the Warner Brothers studio system collaborated for the fourth time; actor Humphrey Bogart and director Michael Curtiz. Their first effort for the studio resulted in Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), a picture that cemented Bogey's reputation as the \"No. 1 Bad Boy.\" Casablanca followed in 1942, capturing the Best Director Oscar for Curtiz and securing film immortality. And their third collaboration was Passage to Marseille (1944), a combination war film and prison escape thriller. So it only makes sense that their final film together would be . . .a light holiday comedy? [PAR] Curtiz and Bogart picked We're No Angels (1955), a story of three escaped convicts from Devil's Island, that was based on the French play La Cuisine des Anges by Albert Husson. An atypical outing for both Bogart and Curtiz, We're No Angels begins with the prison escapees planning to rob and murder husband and wife shopkeepers. However, they quickly reason that \"cutting their throats might spoil their Christmas,\" so the men decide instead to get the financially unstable store back on track by fixing the place up and bringing in more customers. As business begins to boom, Andre Trochard, the owner of the store, arrives on the scene with some greedy schemes of his own. Throw in a deadly snake named Adolph (one of the convict's pet), and the fun begins. [PAR] Bogart plays Joseph, ringleader of the convicts. He is joined by Peter Ustinov as Jules and Aldo Ray rounds out the group as Albert, the snake's owner. Ustinov had just completed The Egyptian (1954), also directed by Curtiz, and both men were looking forward to working together again. On the set, Ustinov and Bogart would become good friends as well, although Humphrey was prone to childish pranks like putting raw liver in his colleague's shoes, something Peter understandably did not find hilarious. Although Ustinov remembers filming fondly, he was rapidly tiring of Hollywood, comparing it to \"a gigantic World's Fair they haven't had time to tear down.\" [PAR] The fastidious Curtiz was also a target for Bogart's amusement, falling for fake dog poop in his trailer. Sophomoric hijinks aside, however, Curtiz sought to further diversify his repertoire by tackling the comedy genre with We're No Angels and for the most part, he succeeds; Ustinov's impeccable comic timing flourishes under his direction and even Bogey's sneer softens to a smile. Basil Rathbone plays the sinister storeowner with glee, a delightful parody of the villain roles he performed prior to his Sherlock Holmes typecasting. And Joan Bennett is particularly memorable as the kindly shopkeeper wife. Bennett, best known as Spencer Tracy's wife in Father of the Bride (1950), had been away from the screen for almost three years after being embroiled in a scandal that effectively blackballed her from Hollywood. In 1951 her husband, producer Walter Wanger shot her lover and agent Jennings Lang in a jealous rage. When the smoke (literally) cleared, Bennett was painted as the antagonist in the lover's triangle and quickly shunned by film society. Bogart, a long-time friend, came through for his fallen colleague with the role in We're No Angels. [PAR] Many of Curtiz's films share a common theme, that of outsiders in an unknown environment. The convicts in We're No Angels are certainly in unchartered territory, but the premise also shares real-life parallels with some of the cast and crew. For Curtiz, it was an attempt to try something different within the rigid formula world of Warner Brothers. For Bogart, it was a break from the rough, hardened characters he previously played and a chance to have fun. And for Bennett, it was a cherished opportunity to participate once again in her chosen profession.

It was released on 16 June 1986 in the United Kingdom by Rough Trade Records and released in the United States on 23 June 1986 through Sire Records. [PAR] The album spent twenty two weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number two. Across the Atlantic, it reached number 28 in Canada on the RPM 100 album chart  and number 70 on the Billboard 200 chart, and was certified Gold by the RIAA in late 1990. It has sold consistently well ever since and has received unanimous critical acclaim, with NME listing it as the greatest album of all time in 2013.  [PAR] Songwriting [PAR] Guitarist Johnny Marr wrote several songs that would later appear on The Queen Is Dead while the Smiths toured Britain in early 1985, working out song arrangements with bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce during soundchecks.  The title of the album is from the novel, \"Last Exit to Brooklyn\" by author Hubert Selby, Jr..  The title of the album could be a reference to the scene in Macbeth where Seyton informs the title character of his wife's murder (\"The queen, my Lord, is dead\").  The title could also refer to a scene in Cymbeline where Cornelius, the doctor, informs Cymbeline, the king, \"The queen is dead.\" [PAR] \"The Boy with the Thorn in His Side\" was, according to Marr, \"an effortless piece of music\", and was written on tour in the spring of 1985. The song's lyrics refer allegorically to the band's experience of the music industry that failed to appreciate it. In 2003, Morrissey named this as his favourite Smiths song.  [PAR] A demo of the music for \"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others\" was posted by Marr through Morrissey's letterbox in the summer of 1985. Morrissey then completed the song by adding lyrics. Marr has stated that he \"preferred the music to the lyrics\". [PAR] \"Frankly, Mr. Shankly\", \"I Know It's Over\" and \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\" were written by Morrissey and Marr in a \"marathon\" writing session in the late summer of 1985 at Marr's home in Bowdon, Greater Manchester. The first of these is reputed to have been addressed to Geoff Travis, head of the Smiths' record label Rough Trade. Travis has since described it as \"a funny lyric\" about \"Morrissey's desire to be somewhere else\", acknowledging that a line in the song about \"bloody awful poetry\" was a reference to a poem he had written for Morrissey.  [PAR] \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\" features lyrics drawn from \"Lonely Planet Boy\" by the New York Dolls. According to Marr: \"When we first played it, I thought it was the best song I'd ever heard\". The guitar part of \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out' draws on the Rolling Stones cover of Marvin Gaye's \"Hitch Hike\", a song that, itself, was an inspiration for the Velvet Underground's \"There She Goes Again\".  [PAR] The music for \"Never Had No One Ever\", completed in August 1985, was based on a demo which Marr had recorded in December 1984, itself based on \"I Need Somebody\" by the Stooges. According to Marr: \"The atmosphere of that track pretty much sums up the whole album and what it was like recording it.\" The lyric to the song reflects Morrissey's feeling unsafe and, being from an immigrant family, not at home on the streets of Manchester.  [PAR] \"The Boy with the Thorn in His Side\", \"Bigmouth Strikes Again\" and \"Frankly, Mr. Shankly\" were debuted live during a tour of Scotland in September and October, during which \"The Queen Is Dead\" and \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\" were soundchecked. \"The Queen is Dead\" was based on a song Marr began writing as a teenager. \"Cemetry Gates\" (sic)\n\n\n### Answer:\nsmiths </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] source: UNESCO/ERI [PAR] Outstanding Universal Value [PAR] Brief synthesis [PAR] The Route of Santiago de Compostela (Camino de Santiago) is a narrow route through the north of the Iberian Peninsula extending over 800 km from the Spanish-French border to the city of Santiago de Compostela, passing through five different Autonomous Communities and over one hundred inhabited towns. [PAR] The Camino de Santiago was originally a religious pilgrimage route culminating in the visit to the tomb of St James the Apostle at the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela (Galicia). The first source tracing the Apostle to Spain dates back to the end of the 6th century. The Acts of the Apostles attribute the evangelisation of Hispania to St James. This information was later corroborated in De ortu et obitu Patrum by Isidoro de Sevilla (7th century) and in the Commentarium in Apocalypsin by St Beatus of Liebana (8th century). The discovery of the Apostle's tomb in Galicia dates to the 9th century under the rule of Alfonso II the Chaste. As a result of St Jerome\u2019s teachings that the resting place of the Apostles should be in the province where they had preached the gospel, the remains of St. James were taken from Jerusalem to Spain. The news of the discovery spread quickly throughout Western Europe, and Santiago de Compostela became a pilgrimage site. The historical moment when the tomb was discovered, i.e. 9th century Muslim Spain, defined the scope and importance of the discovery in the Christian world of the time, swiftly transforming the place into a pilgrimage site on par with Jerusalem and Rome. [PAR] During its eleven centuries of known history, the Route of Santiago de Compostela has become a veritable crossroads, fostering ongoing cultural dialogue among the pilgrims travelling it and the towns through which it passes. This route also became an important trade axis and a place for the dissemination of knowledge. Constantly evolving, the Camino includes a set of first-class historical heritage sites, outstanding natural landscapes, and intangible heritage, a prime example\n\n\n### Answer:\nst james </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] A mahout is a person (traditionally male) who works with, takes care of and tends to an elephant. A mahout\u2019s job usually starts at a young age and they often stay with the elephant for the majority (if not their whole) life. Although in some tourism camps an elephant may have multiple mahouts, as these elephants are owned by the camps and not the mahouts themselves. This arrangement is not suggested as a mahout-elephant bond is a strong, trusting one and not one that can be interchanged with other mahouts. [PAR] Traditionally there were\u00a0three distinct types of mahouts, the Yukthimah who use ingenuity to outsmart their elephants, the Reghawan who use love in their training, and the Balwan who use cruelty to teach their elephants to behave. [PAR] Mahouts often spend more time with their elephant then they do their own families. Being a mahout takes pure dedication as it requires you to spend endless amounts of time caring for your elephant. In a place like the Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai, Thailand, the mahouts spend all day with their elephant, and then take turns amongst each other rotating a night shift to be sure the elephants have all the food, warmth, etc. they need throughout the night. [PAR] Training of a Mahout [PAR] Elephants choose their mahout, they decide whether or not they will accept them, and one of the major deciding factors in this (if done the humane way) is love. If you don\u2019t love your elephant, the elephant will not love you.\u00a0The unfortunate thing is, the tradition of a mahout is dying out, and it is much harder to find a good mahout. Now people are looking at elephants as a way to make money, and many mahouts are getting involved in this field for that reason solely, not for their love of the animal and the tradition. [PAR] The training of a mahout is often passed down from one generation to another, sort of like a family business.\u00a0Back in the old days, being a mahout was a very prestigious occupation and you were seen as a hero. Now-a-days many mahouts aren\u2019t actually trained mahouts, and really know nothing about elephants and how to care for them. This is where the biggest issue is with responsible\u00a0care for domesticated Asian elephants. [PAR] Training used to be in the hands of senior mahouts and monks, now it is often done through training courses that are offered in a few different areas in Asia, apprenticeships at camps, or unfortunately through crash courses where what would normally be taught in years is taught in a few days. [PAR] Organizations like the Save the Elephant Foundation in Chiang Mai are working to better educate mahouts on the proper way to train elephants and how they can use positive reinforcements (like you would with a child) as oppose to mistreatment and abuse. Unfortunately the laws around the misuse of elephants in all Southeast Asian countries are minimal, so organizations like this are key to trying to change the mahout-elephant relationship. [PAR] Training of an Elephant [PAR] This is where the controversy starts around mahouts in Southeast Asia and beyond. There are several inhumane ways to train an elephant that unfortunately are what is giving mahouts a bad reputation.

Beetles, caterpillars, cicadas, flies, and other insects are also taken, and in summer small fruits are eaten. Summer tanagers normally creep along tree branches scanning for insects, but they can also hover to glean insects from hanging leaves or capture flying insects with short flights from a perch. [PAR] Nesting Behavior [PAR] The nest of a summer tanager is a rather shallow, flimsy cup of weed stems, leaves, and fine grasses, built by the female on a horizontal branch well away from the tree trunk. The usual clutch of eggs is four, incubated by the female for 12 days. Both parents feed the nestlings until they leave the nest at about two weeks of age. [PAR] WOW!

Christened and launched on Thursday, June 7, 1906. Lusitania met a disastrous end as a casualty of the First World War when she was torpedoed by the German submarine U-20 on May 7, 1915. The great ship sank in just 18 minutes, eight miles (15 km) off the Old Head of Kinsale, Ireland, killing 1,198 of the people aboard. The sinking turned public opinion in many countries against Germany. [PAR] RMS Mauretania, sister ship of the Lusitania, was an ocean liner built by Swan, Hunter & Wigham Richardson at Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, and was launched on September 20, 1906. At the time, she was the largest and fastest ship in the world. Particularly notable was her steam turbine propulsion, which was a revolutionary development in ocean liner design. Mauretania became a favourite among the passengers,[1] attributable to her luxury, speed, and safety. [PAR] The ship's name was taken from Mauretania a Roman Province on the northwest African coast, not related to the modern Mauritania.

Written between October 1845 and June 1846,  Wuthering Heights was published in 1847 under the pseudonym \"Ellis Bell\"; Bront\u00eb died the following year, aged 30. Wuthering Heights and Anne Bront\u00eb's Agnes Grey were accepted by publisher Thomas Newby before the success of their sister Charlotte's novel, Jane Eyre. After Emily's death, Charlotte edited the manuscript of Wuthering Heights, and arranged for the edited version to be published as a posthumous second edition in 1850.  [PAR] Although Wuthering Heights is now widely regarded as a classic of English literature, contemporary reviews for the novel were deeply polarised; it was considered controversial because its depiction of mental and physical cruelty was unusually stark, and it challenged strict Victorian ideals of the day, including religious hypocrisy, morality, social classes and gender inequality.   The English poet and painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti referred to it as \"A fiend of a book\u00a0\u2013 an incredible monster\u00a0 [...] The action is laid in hell,\u00a0\u2013 only it seems places and people have English names there.\"  [PAR] In the second half of the 19th century, Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre was considered the best of the Bront\u00eb sisters' works, but following later re-evaluation, critics began to argue that Wuthering Heights was superior.

He visits his landlord, Heathcliff, who lives in a remote moorland farmhouse, Wuthering Heights. There Lockwood finds an odd assemblage: Heathcliff seems to be a gentleman, but his manners are uncouth; the reserved mistress of the house is in her mid-teens; and a young man seems to be a member of the family, yet dresses and speaks as if he is a servant.

When nothing happens, Heathcliff shows Lockwood to his own bedroom and returns to keep watch at the window. [PAR] At sunrise Heathcliff escorts Lockwood back to Thrushcross Grange.

[PAR] Limbic System [PAR] The limbic system is a set of brain structures located on top of the brainstem and buried under the cortex . Limbic system structures are involved in many of our emotions and motivations, particularly those that are related to survival. Such emotions include fear, anger, and emotions related to sexual behavior. The limbic system is also involved in feelings of pleasure that are related to our survival, such as those experienced from eating and sex. The limbic system influences both the peripheral nervous system and the endocrine system . [PAR] Certain structures of the limbic system are involved in memory as well. Two large limbic system structures, the amygdala and hippocampus play important roles in memory. The amygdala is responsible for determining what memories are stored and where the memories are stored in the brain . It is thought that this determination is based on how huge an emotional response an event invokes. The hippocampus sends memories out to the appropriate part of the cerebral hemisphere for long-term storage and retrieves them when necessary. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Facts About the Titanic That You Don't Know [PAR] Damage to this area of the brain may result in an inability to form new memories. [PAR] Part of the forebrain known as the diencephalon is also included in the limbic system. The diencephalon is located beneath the cerebral hemispheres and contains the thalamus and hypothalamus . The thalamus is involved in sensory perception and regulation of motor functions (i.e., movement). It connects areas of the cerebral cortex that are involved in sensory perception and movement with other parts of the brain and spinal cord that also have a role in sensation and movement. The hypothalamus is a very small but important component of the diencephalon. It plays a major role in regulating hormones , the pituitary gland , body temperature, the adrenal glands , and many other vital activities. [PAR] Limbic System Structures [PAR] Amygdala - almond shaped mass of nuclei involved in emotional responses, hormonal secretions, and memory. The amygdala is responsible for fear conditioning or the associative learning process by which we learn to fear something. [PAR] Cingulate Gyrus - a fold in the brain involved with sensory input concerning emotions and the regulation of aggressive behavior. [PAR] Fornix - an arching, band of white matter axons (nerve fibers) that connect the hippocampus to the hypothalamus. [PAR] Hippocampus - a tiny nub that acts as a memory indexer -- sending memories out to the appropriate part of the cerebral hemisphere for long-term storage and retrieving them when necessary. [PAR] Hypothalamus - about the size of a pearl, this structure directs a multitude of important functions. It wakes you up in the morning, and gets the adrenaline flowing. The hypothalamus is also an important emotional center, controlling the molecules that make you feel exhilarated, angry, or unhappy. [PAR] Olfactory Cortex - receives sensory information from the olfactory bulb and is involved in the identification of odors. [PAR] Thalamus - a large, dual lobed mass of gray matter cells that relay sensory signals to and from the spinal cord and the cerebrum . [PAR] In summary, the limbic system is responsible for controlling various functions in the body. Some of these functions include interpreting emotional responses, storing memories, and regulating hormones .

One notable, yet ancient and misguided example is that of Aristotle's Temperate, Torrid, and Frigid Zones . However, the 20th century classification developed by German climatologist and amateur botanist Wladimir Koppen (1846-1940) continues to be the authoritative map of the world climates in use today. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] What are the Seven Wonders of the World [PAR] Introduced in 1928 as a wall map co-authored with student Rudolph Geiger, the Koppen system of classification was updated and modified by Koppen until his death. Since that time, it has been modified by several geographers. The most common modification of the K\u00f6ppen system today is that of the late University of Wisconsin geographer Glen Trewartha. [PAR] The modified Koppen classification uses six letters to divide the world into six major climate regions, based on average annual precipitation, average monthly precipitation, and average monthly temperature: [PAR] A for Tropical Humid [PAR] E for Polar [PAR] H for Highland (this classification was added after K\u00f6ppen created his system) [PAR] Each category is further divided into sub-categories based on temperature and precipitation. For instance, the U.S. states located along the Gulf of Mexico are designated as \"Cfa.\" The \"C\" represents the \"mild mid-latitude\" category, the second letter \"f\" stands for the German word feucht or \"moist,\" and the third letter \"a\" indicates that the average temperature of the warmest month is above 72\u00b0F (22\u00b0C). Thus, \"Cfa\" gives us a good indication of the climate of this region, a mild mid-latitude climate with no dry season and a hot summer. [PAR] While the Koppen system doesn't take such things as temperature extremes, average cloud cover, number of days with sunshine, or wind into account, it's a good representation of our earth's climate. With only 24 different subclassifications , grouped into the six categories, the system is easy to comprehend.

W\u00e9pion's berries are known throughout the country, as the best strawberry, and their arrival on store shelves is eagerly anticipated. [PAR] In fact, the town loves its red berries so much, they have their own museum, the Mus\u00e9e de la Fraise, or Strawberry Museum. [PAR] This tiny museum tells the history of strawberry growing and production in this region and explains its importance to the economy and culture of W\u00e9pion. [PAR] The museum also boasts a small shop of strawberry products (pictured here) including: jams, candies, liqueur and, of course, strawberry beer (It is Belgium after all).

If you're living in the Flanders area, chances are high that strawberries come from Melsele . For the regions of Wallonia and Brussels, strawberries come from\u00a0 W\u00e9pion, a small town near Namur. [PAR] W\u00e9pion is the strawberry capital of the Walloon Region. On the banks of the Meuse river, inside a Mosan mansion, you will find the strawberry museum , with its 5-room exhibition on the history and culture of strawberries in the region. [PAR] Our visit of the 5 rooms would be over very quickly, were it not that the museum staff has lots of stories to share on strawberries. We were also fortunate that another group was visiting the museum while we arrived, and we could join a walking tour of W\u00e9pion, animated by a museum guide. [PAR] The tour came as a nice surprise, full of little factoids on W\u00e9pion. The town was a 19th century retreat for industrialists who built mansions along the Meuse bank as holiday residences. These mansions are largely preserved, though W\u00e9pion also has its struggles with project developers. [PAR] The walking tour does not come standard with the visit, but the museum animator has such passion for the museum and his town that he probably does not need much convincing if your group is large enough. Otherwise, nothing prohibits you to take a walk on your own - you'll miss the stories, but the scenery alone suffices (some guidebooks with various walks are available from the museum shop). [PAR] After the museum visit, a tasting of local products is offered (included in the entrance fee). You have the choice between juice (mixed apple/strawberry) and alcohol. Personally, I find strawberries one of the few fruits not suitable for alcohol, but the juice is nice and seems to be appreciated by most. [PAR] In conclusion, this museum in combination with a visit to the town is a nice conclusion of your day in the Province of Namur. The strawberry season is long in W\u00e9pion.

Plutarch, on the other hand, says that Caesar died in silence, pulling his toga over his head. | Notes and Queries | guardian.co.uk [PAR] STAGE AND SCREEN [PAR] Why did Shakespeare make Julius Caesar's last words the Latin 'Et tu, Brute?' when Suetonius tells us they were the Greek 'Kai su, teknon?' (You too, my son?)? Plutarch, on the other hand, says that Caesar died in silence, pulling his toga over his head. [PAR] THE answer is simple. The ancient historians such as Suetonius and Plutarch were as much in the entertainment business as the great playwright. Phrases like Suetonius's 'Kai su, teknon' and Plutarch's dramatic descriptions, were as much for the enjoyment of the reader/listener as for the true recording of fact. Shakespeare simply used the line 'Et tu Brute' because it suited his dramatic purpose, just as Plutarch and Suetonius had used what suited them. Personally, I suspect Julius Caesar's last words were 'aaaaaaaaaaah'. [PAR] Jonathan Munn, Whitchurch, Cardiff. [PAR] I THINK it's generally accepted that Caesar's dying words were the Greek 'Kai su, teknon'. Romans of his class moved easily between Latin and Greek. But it's important to recognise that he was not asking 'You too, my son?' The words 'Kai su' - found in Greek comedy and on mosaics - mean 'Screw you!' and the 'teknon' ('kid') just makes it fiercer. [PAR] Greg Rowe, The Queen's College, Oxford. [PAR] I MUST point out that Shakespeare does not make Caesar's last words 'Et tu, Brute?' Shakespeare gives him another three words after the famous quotation: 'Then fall Caesar!' [PAR] Eric Standidge, London SE10. [PAR] As we all know, the old Greek language doesn't have anything to do with a modern Greek language and no Greeks can understand the old one. The only people who do understand it are Albanians.

Kai -Cray SU- like you Te`knon- singing Shakespeare was in Albania a few times and he maybe understood the Albanian language. [PAR] Lamun Dardanian, Kosova Albania [PAR] It expresses a meaning that cannot be made in English - using tu implies a closeness, such as brother.

In 1658 the grand-daughter of James I of England (and VI of Scotland), and daughter of Elizabeth of Bohemia, by name Sophia, married Ernst Augustus. He was the Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg, and became an Elector (Prince of the Holy Roman Empire with the right to elect the Emperor) of Germany in 1692. He took Hanover as his princely title and capital city. [PAR] It was Sophia and Ernst\u2019s son (born 1660) who became George I, the first of the House of Hanover to be King of England (actually Great Britain and Ireland). Hanover as a territory contained important towns like G\u00f6ttingen and Hildersheim. The defence of these places was to become a serious factor in British foreign policy during the eighteenth century. [PAR] So how was it that a full-blooded German ascended the throne of England?\u00a0 The answer is because George\u2019s mother Sophia and her issue were recognised as heirs to the throne by the Act of Settlement in 1701, which excluded the Roman Catholic Stuarts. George moved to England to become king in 1714 on the death of Queen Anne \u2013 herself a descendent of Catholic Mary Queen of Scots. [PAR] George I did not speak English, did not like London, did not like British constitutionalism or the need to accept the limitations of Parliament; after being crowned he spent as much time as he could in Hanover, where he grudgingly agreed to be taught the English language. Throughout the rest of his life he spoke it with a heavy German accent. He reigned without the help of any queen, having divorced his wife Sophia Dorothea in 1694. [PAR] The Hanoverians reigned in Britain from George I to Victoria, 1714 to 1901. George was succeeded by his son George II, who [PAR] disliked and resented his father; however, he married very well with Caroline of Ansbach and accepted Walpole as his Prime Minister and adviser. Following family tradition he disliked his son Frederick Louis. On the positive side he was the last British King to lead his troops in battle, at Dettingen in 1743, while supporting Empress Maria Theresa in the War of the Austrian Succession. His despised son Frederick was the father of George III, the third of the Hanoverian succession. [PAR] This George was the first actually to be born in England! He was not a bad king at all but he suffered horribly from porphyria, a metabolic disease which causes mental disturbance, which is why most Englishmen thought their monarch was mad.

Custom molded rubber materials serve a variety of purposes, and can often mean the difference between life and death. Rubber respiratory safety masks for instance, need to be made 100% to specifications and be non-defective to properly function and withstand exposure to toxic chemicals and airborne contaminants. Advanced Rubber Products fully understands the importance of our customers\u2019 rubber needs. Our team takes full responsibility for product reliability. For example, a polymer insulator , which costs less than $100 per unit, is designed to blow up and save a $15,000 transformer from destructing. If the rubber component fails to do its job correctly, the costs quickly grow. [PAR] Rubber is not only a cost effective means of protecting the most valuable parts of your business, it\u2019s also one of the most pliable and durable materials. However, in the process of custom rubber molding, excess material is inevitable. With some smaller and more oddly shaped parts, it can be even more difficult to remove this excess material. Advanced Rubber Products uses the highly effective and precise process of cryogenic deflashing to remove unwanted or unnecessary rubber from custom molded components. The molded pieces are placed inside a chamber with a temperature of minus 60\u00b0F, making the excess material extremely brittle. The part is then bombarded with tiny pellets, removing all the excess rubber flash. [PAR] ARP understands the importance of your products and realizes that if an unexpected event occurs (i.e. extreme weather), you may need a large amount of custom rubber products in a short amount of time. This is why we maintain a well-organized warehouse with extra on-demand products. So if your business requires a large rush order, Advanced Rubber Products is able to fulfill your request at a moment\u2019s notice. We will store your extra parts so you don\u2019t have to.

The port, although a valuable strategic outpost, was a huge drain on the King\u2019s financial resources. However, there can be no doubt that even a greater motive was the vital need to forge closer relationships with France. [PAR] Dunkirk was essentially a liability to the Crown, its aforementioned strategic position notwithstanding. It didn\u2019t serve any purpose; for instance, a trade with neighbourhood population was impossible owning to the intense dislike of the latter for everything English. The costs of maintaining a garrison there were huge and, it was also a save heaven for pirates and no vessels. Admiral Montague, Earl of Sandwich, was thus hugely in favour of a sale: in fact, at the time he indicated himself to be the foremost author of the sale of Dunkirk. While he wanted it to be restored to the Spaniards, the Chancellor reminded him that Spain was in no position to pay the huge sum English were planning to request. France, on the other hand, was not only capable of that, but it would also greatly benefit the alliance with the country that Charles II so strongly sought. [PAR] Critics of the move pointed out that dandling Dunkirk to the French would be a suicide; the possession of Calais and Dunkirk would enable them to essentially hold a knife to the throat of England. They argued that if the costs of maintaining were so high, it might be better to fill up the harbours than to hand them over to the French. They also proposed to request the Parliament a special grant for it. [PAR] Louis XIV of France [PAR] These considerations, however, made no impression either on the King or on the Chancellor. They didn\u2019t think that the loss of Dunkirk would involve any danger to England, nor did they see a purpose in keeping it. During the time of the Commonwealth of England, Cromwell thought the possession of the fortress to be vitally important because he aimed to exercise considerable power on the mainland. Charles II\u2019s foreign policy was markedly different; he had given up any ideas of unified Protestant countries and was actually quite anxious to isolate the English Church from continental influences. [PAR] And so, French ambassador, Estrades, was called upon with a task of contacting the French King with the following proposal: that if a treaty for the sale of Dunkirk could contribute to a close alliance between the two Kings \u2013 and it was clear that the English Monarch could give no stronger proof of his earnest desire to fain the friendship of the French Monarch \u2013 then England was prepared to make the move. Louis XIV\u2019s response was swift: the King replied that he felt the strongest wish to enter into the closest friendship and alliance with his brother, the King of England. As soon as that reply was received, Estrades left for England to conclude the sale. [PAR] It was at this time when English ministers and Parliament were asked to review the proposal. Extraordinarily, it was Portugal\u2019s position that silenced all objections: Portugal, along with England, was at war with Spain at the time and had recently lost some strong places of importance to the latter. They needed military assistance of the English which could not have been granted because the Treasury quite literally had nothing to pay his \u00a0soldiers with. Moreover, a support from England would have been impossible unless a strong alliance was forged between France and England. In the end, the Ministers consented to the King\u2019s decision. [PAR] Godefroi, Comte d'Estrades [PAR] The key issue was of course the sum to be paid: initially, Estrades was given the permission to agree to only 2 million livres. However, the English would not agree to less than 5 million.

[PAR] One of the potentially most promising means for delivering and receiving information to and from digital computers involves the display of computer outputs as visual representations on a cathode ray tube and the alteration of the display by a human operator in order to deliver instructions to the computer. In order for a human operator to readily change the displayed pattern, he must be provided with means for accurately indicating the exact position on the visual display at which he can make alterations. Devices are known which enable accurate position location on the tube display, such as a light pencil detector which is held against the tube while the entire tube is swept by the beam, the instant at which light is detected during the time required to sweep the entire face indicating the detectors position. [PAR] A disadvantage of the light pencil and other similar devices is that they generally require the human operator to hold the pencil against the CRT with one hand while changes are made. Consequently, the operator does not have both hands free to enter changes, as by typing them in, and cannot move to equipment only a step away from the CRT. Furthermore, the light pencil often covers part of the area of the CRT display where changes are to be entered, which interferes with the process. [PAR] , SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One subject of the invention is to provide an X-Y position indicating control mechanism for controlling indications of positions on a cathode ray tube (CRT) display, by movement along a surface which can be other than the face of the CRT. [PAR] Another object of the invention is to provide a position indicator control which transmits signals defining its position on a surface, and which is connected by only a cable to the apparatus which acts upon such information. [PAR] Still another object of the invention is to provide a simple and improved X-Y position locating device. [PAR] The foregoing and other objects are realized by an X-Y position indicator control mechanism comprising a small housing adapted to be held in the hand and having two wheels and an idler ball bearing for contacting the surface\n\n\n### Answer:\ncursor </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

The subunit of taka that divides 1 unit of the currency into 100               equal parts is \"paise\". It is often depicted by \"\u09f3\" or \"\u09f2\" symbols in the local language of the country and as \"Tk\" in the English language. According to the International               Organization for Standardization, 4217 standard, Bangladeshi taka               is assigned with BDT as the currency code and 050 as the numeric               code. [PAR] The word \"taka\" is derived from the Sanskrit word \"tanka\" that was used as a denomination for a silver               coin of a certain mass. The wide usage of the word in India for               money reference in general especially in Bengal was the reason               that it was made the national currency of this \"Bangla\" speaking country.

[PAR] References [PAR] Wikipedia , licensed under the GFDL [PAR] 02f33fg [PAR] The H\u00f4tel Matignon (French pronunciation:\u00a0) is the official residence of the Prime Minister of France. It is located in the VIIe arrondissement of Paris, France. [PAR] The address of Hotel Matignon is 57 rue de Varenne, Paris, France. [PAR] History [PAR] In 1649, as part of his plan for the construction of the H\u00f4tel des Invalides, Louis XIV decided to restore the old \"Chemin du Bois de la Garenne,\" which had become the \"Rue de Varenne,\" that linked Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, at the western end of Paris, with the marshy terrain chosen as the new building site. Henceforth the \"Noble Faubourg\" gained a new lease on life, the proximity of Versailles being irresistible for an aristocracy who lived exclusively by and for the Court. [PAR] On September 30, 1717, Christian-Louis de Montmorency Luxembourg, Prince of Tigny and Marshal of France, purchased, for the sum of 91 Livres, 2869 toises (30,000 m\u00b2) of land along the Rue de Varenne. He was a lover of gardens and intended to create a country park. In 1722, he commissioned a little-known architect, Jean Courtonne, to conceive and construct a mansion. His success in this endeavor won him entry to the Academy of Architecture, where he wrote a much-remarked Treatise on Perspectives (1725). But the expense of the enterprise forced the Prince of Tigny to sell, and it was the Count of Matignon who bought the H\u00f4tel, completed in 1725, as a present for his son, the Duke of Valentinois. [PAR] Courtonne's design was highly original. Rising from a broad terrace, the main residence, a single-storey building crowned by a balustrade, comprises two suites of rooms. Access from the street is gained by a portico ornamented by columns. This archway reveals the main courtyard, bracketed by two low wings of offices and outbuildings, to the right of which are situated another courtyard, the stables and the kitchens. The fa\u00e7ade is broken by three advances. Those to the right and left house the staircases, while the central pavilion displays a magnificent balcony sculpted with lion motifs. Visitors' admiration is drawn by two singular architectural features: the segmented cupola of the entrance hall and, to its right, the first room to have been originally designed for dining. The fa\u00e7ade seen from the garden runs the entire length of the buildings, concealing the main courtyard and the servants' yard. Although the design results in a slight imbalance in the natural disposition of the mansion, it respects the placement of a central pavilion with three panels surmounted by a broken pediment bearing the arms of the owners. [PAR] Its rich interiors made the H\u00f4tel Matignon one of the most elegant and most frequented mansions of Paris. The wood panelling is the work of Michel Lange, who had already decorated the Grand Salon of the H\u00f4tel d'\u00c9vreux (today the Ambassadors' Salon of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. The cornices and the stucco work are by Jean-Martin Pelletier and Jean Herpin. At the time, any \"well-dressed\" person was authorized by the owners to visit these splendors in their absence. [PAR] In 1731, the wife of Jacques de Matignon, daughter of Anthony I Grimaldi, succeeded her father as head of the principality of Monaco. In 1734, their son, Honor\u00e9 III, mounted the throne. Although he was open to the revolutionary ideas of the time, he was imprisoned on September 20, 1793. At his liberation a year later, he was ruined, and his property under seal. His sons obtained restitution, but were obliged to put the mansion up for sale in 1802. [PAR] It was bought by Anne \u00c9l\u00e9onore Franchi. A professional dancer, she caught the eye, at the Carnival of Venice, of Karl Eugen, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, who had three children by her. The Duke died in 1793, and finding herself in Vienna and once more a dancer, she became the mistress of Joseph II.

Leadhills village is approximately 1295 feet or 395 metres high and is located in the Lowther Hills. The town of Leadhills was first founded and developed because of the large quantity of lead situated in this particular area, which was later extensively mined. [PAR] The village of Leadhills can be reached by two roads, the B797 that goes from Abington and the B7040 from Elvanfoot. There is a Museum of Lead Mining in Wanlockhead that you can go visit if you are interested in finding out more about Leadhills' history. [PAR] In 1741 a number of lead miners formed the Leadhills Reading Society. Today it is considered the oldest subscription library in the whole of the United Kingdom. These twenty-three lead miners collected and put together enough money to build the Reading Society to service the Leadhills, Wanlockhead and surrounding areas. [PAR] This gave people the opportunity to take out books to read if they so desired, but it did come at a price. First a joining fee would have to be paid and then each year an annual subscription of \u00a30.10 would have to be paid in order for one to stay a member. Today the Leadhills Library is still around and continues to have a wonderful collection of books that date back to the 1800s. [PAR] Another attraction you can visit is the Leadhills Station, dating back to 1901. The station is considered the highest railway station in the country where you can view a variety of industrial engines that were used back-in-the-day. From 1901 to 1939 the Leadhills Station was run between the Elvanfoot and Wanlockhead villages, but has since been discontinued. [PAR] Leadhills is also known as having the highest golf course in the country, lying at 1 500 feet above sea level. The nine hole course is quite challenging with golfers having to contend with strong winds and a hilly layout.

He is a cultural icon of teenage disillusionment and social estrangement, as expressed in the title of his most celebrated film, Rebel Without a Cause (1955), in which he starred as troubled teenager Jim Stark. The other two roles that defined his stardom were loner Cal Trask in East of Eden (1955) and surly ranch hand Jett Rink in Giant (1956). [PAR] Dean's premature death in a car crash cemented his legendary status.  He became the first actor to receive a posthumous Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, and remains the only actor to have had two posthumous acting nominations.  In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked him the 18th best male movie star of Golden Age Hollywood in AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars list.  [PAR] Early life [PAR] James Dean was born at the Seven Gables apartment house at the corner of 4th Street and McClure Street in Marion, Indiana,  the son of Winton Dean (January 17, 1907 \u2013 February 21, 1995) and Mildred Marie Wilson (September 15, 1910 \u2013 July 14, 1940). His parents were of mostly English ancestry, with smaller amounts of Scottish, German, Irish and Welsh.   Six years after his father had left farming to become a dental technician, Dean and his family moved to Santa Monica, California. He was enrolled at Brentwood Public School in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, but transferred soon afterward to the McKinley Elementary school.  The family spent several years there, and by all accounts, young Dean was very close to his mother. According to Michael DeAngelis, she was \"the only person capable of understanding him.\"  In 1938, she was suddenly struck with acute stomach pains and began to lose weight quickly. She died of uterine cancer when Dean was nine years old. [PAR] Unable to care for his son, Dean's father sent him to live with his sister Ortense and her husband, Marcus Winslow, on a farm in Fairmount, Indiana,  where he was raised in their Quaker household.  Winton served in World War II and later remarried. In his adolescence, Dean sought the counsel and friendship of a local Methodist pastor, the Rev. James DeWeerd. DeWeerd seemed to have had a formative influence upon Dean, especially upon his future interests in bullfighting, car racing, and theater.  According to Billy J. Harbin, Dean had \"an intimate relationship with his pastor, which began in his senior year of high school and endured for many years.\"   Their alleged sexual relationship was earlier suggested in the 1994 book Boulevard of Broken Dreams: The Life, Times, and Legend of James Dean by Paul Alexander.  In 2011, it was reported that he once confided in Elizabeth Taylor that he was sexually abused by a minister approximately two years after his mother's death.  Other reports on Dean's life also suggest that he was either sexually abused by DeWeerd as a child or had a sexual relationship with him as a late teenager. [PAR] His overall performance in school was exceptional and he was also considered to be a popular student. He played on the baseball and varsity basketball teams, studied drama, and competed in public speaking through the Indiana High School Forensic Association. After graduating from Fairmount High School in May 1949,  Dean moved back to California with his dog, Max, to live with his father and stepmother. He enrolled in Santa Monica College (SMC) and majored in pre-law. He transferred to UCLA for one semester,  and changed his major to drama,  which resulted in estrangement from his father. He pledged the Sigma Nu fraternity but was never initiated.  While at UCLA, Dean was picked from a group of 350 actors to portray Malcolm in Macbeth.  At that time, he also began acting in James Whitmore's workshop. In January 1951, he dropped out of UCLA to pursue a full-time career as an actor.

It has also belonged to the corporation of New York City, to the State, and to several private owners. [PAR] The Mohegan Indians called it \"Minnissais, meaning Lesser Island. At various times it has been known as \"Great Oyster,\" \"Love Island,\" \"Bedloo's Island,\" \"Kennedy's Island,\" \"Corporation Island,\" \"Bedlow's Island\"\u0097an anglicized form of the original owner's name\u0097and now \"Bedloe's,\" a spelling for which there is no historical basis. [PAR] Under Dutch sovereignty the island became the property of Isaack Bedloo, merchant and \"select burgher\" of New Amsterdam, who was born in Calais, France. His name was listed with 94 others in the \"Remonstrance of the People of New Netherlands to the Director-General and Council\"\u0097a protest of public-spirited citizens to Holland against certain intolerable conditions. So it was not surprising that under English rule the island was formally granted to him by Governor Nicolls of New York. [PAR] Bedloo is believed to have died in 1673. His estate retained the island until 1732, when his daughter Mary sold it to Adolphe Philipse and Henry Lane for 5 shillings. During their ownership the island was temporarily commandeered as the first quarantine station by the city, which feared \"that small-pox and other malignant fevers may be brought in from South Carolina, Barbadoes, Antigua, and other places, where they have great mortality.\" [PAR] In 1746, Archibald Kennedy bought the island for the sum of \u00a3100, for use as a summer home. During his ownership the State ordered the erection of a beacon on Bedloe's Island, for the purpose of warning New Jersey, Connecticut, and New York of the approach of an enemy. [PAR] In 1756, the Governor of New York instructed Kennedy, as presiding councillor of New York, to exercise all possible. precautions to prevent the introduction of smallpox, which was then raging in Philadelphia. Kennedy permitted the use of his island again as a temporary quarantine station. In 1759, the Corporation of the City of New York bought the island for \u00a31,000 to erect a pest-house. During the next few years it was leased to several different persons for varied periods of time. [PAR] When the English occupied New York they seized Bedloe's Island and used it as a refuge for Tory sympathizers. Objecting to this use, rebels managed to set fire to all the buildings on the island and to do other damage. [PAR] The French came into the picture in 1793, using Bedloe's Island as an isolation station for 3 years. In 1796, the island was conveyed to the ownership of New York State for use as a hospital site or any other desired purpose. [PAR] By this time steps had been taken by the newly organized Federal Government, in conjunction with the State, to erect fortifications to protect New York Harbor. Three sites\u0097Governor's Island, Ellis Island, and Bedloe's Island\u0097were chosen for defense fortifications, and on February 15, 1800, by act of the New York Legislature, the three islands were ceded to the United States Government. [PAR] Outer battery, Fort Wood, 1890. [PAR] Construction of a land battery, in the shape of an 11-point star, was begun on Bedloe's Island in 1806 and finished 5 years later.

A hemispherectomy, therefore, means the surgical removal of a hemisphere\u2014a half\u2014of the brain. Yes, it is possible for people to survive this procedure, and even recover almost all their normal functions. The extent of recovery depends on the age of the patient at the time of the procedure. Six-year-old Jesse will most likely experience some side effects, but the surgery represented the best hope for her survival. [PAR] Somehow, removing half of a brain is unlike removing half of a heart. Without aid (like a left ventricular assist device, or LVAD), half a heart is useless. The brain, however, is a different matter. It is actually partly grey matter, which consists of neurons. The neurons of one hemisphere are able to learn new tasks and take over functions of the removed hemisphere. [PAR] Hemispherectomies performed prior to the mid 1970s involved the total removal of one half of the brain. This led to complications, as body fluids built up too much pressure in the vacant cavity. Today, a middle section (the temporal lobe) of the affected hemisphere is removed. The front and back lobes (frontal and occipital)\u2014now disconnected from each other\u2014are left in place, partly as cranial spacers. [PAR] This procedure is a last resort, undertaken only after medications fail to curb uncontrollable seizures. Recovery is long and difficult. However, the fact that recovery is even possible testifies to the brain\u2019s remarkable capacity to learn. Biomedical research is revealing an unexpected picture of neuronal adaptability.2 Our Creator foresaw various needs for mental flexibility and wired the brain with a capacity to meet those needs. Indeed, we are fearfully and wonderfully made.3 [PAR] References[DOC] [TLE] Strange but True: When Half a Brain Is Better than a Whole ...Strange but True: When Half a Brain Is Better than a Whole One - Scientific American [PAR] Scientific American [PAR] Health [PAR] Strange but True: When Half a Brain Is Better than a Whole One [PAR] You might not want to do it, but removing half of your brain will not significantly impact who you are [PAR] By Charles Choi on May 24, 2007 [PAR] Credit: COURTESY OF JOHNS HOPKINS CHILDREN'S CENTER [PAR] Advertisement | [PAR] Report Ad [PAR] The operation known as hemispherectomy\u2014where half the brain is removed\u2014sounds too radical to ever consider, much less perform. In the last century, however, surgeons have performed it hundreds of times for disorders uncontrollable in any other way. Unbelievably, the surgery has no apparent effect on personality or memory. [PAR] The first known hemispherectomy was performed on a dog in 1888 by German physiologist Friedrich Goltz. In humans, neurosurgeon Walter Dandy pioneered the operation at Johns Hopkins University in 1923 on a brain tumor patient. (That man lived for more than three years before ultimately succumbing to cancer.) The procedure is among the most drastic kinds of brain surgery\u2014\"You can't take more than half. If you take the whole thing, you've got a problem,\" Johns Hopkins neurologist John Freeman quips. [PAR] One side effect Canadian neurosurgeon Kenneth McKenzie reported in 1938 after a hemispherectomy on a 16-year-old girl who suffered a stroke was that her seizures stopped. Nowadays, the surgery is performed on patients who suffer dozens of seizures every day that resist all medication, and which are due to conditions that mostly afflict one hemisphere. \"These disorders are often progressive and damage the rest of the brain if not treated,\" University of California, Los Angeles, neurosurgeon Gary Mathern says. Freeman concurs: \"Hemispherectomy is something that one only does when the alternatives are worse.\" [PAR] Anatomical hemispherectomies involve the removal of the entire hemisphere, whereas functional hemispherectomies only take out parts of a hemisphere, as well as severing the corpus callosum\n\n\n### Answer:\nbrain </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

After the Civil War, children of local longshoremen and slaughterhouse workers formed posses that fiercely roamed from tenement to tenement\u2014one of which was so dangerous that in 1881 The New York Times dubbed the building Hell's Kitchen, in the moniker's first-ever printing.

During her time in office, she reduced the influence of trade unions, privatized certain industries, scaled back public benefits and changed the terms of political debate, much like her friend and ideological ally, U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Nicknamed the \u201cIron Lady,\u201d she opposed Soviet communism and fought a war to maintain control of the Falkland Islands. The longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century, Thatcher was eventually pressured into resigning by members of her own Conservative Party [PAR] Google [PAR] Margaret Thatcher: The Early Years [PAR] Margaret Hilda Roberts, later Margaret Thatcher, was born on October 13, 1925, in Grantham, a small town in Lincolnshire, England. Her parents, Alfred and Beatrice, were middle-class shopkeepers and devout Methodists. Alfred was also a politician, serving as a town council member for 16 years before becoming an alderman in 1943 and mayor of Grantham from 1945 to 1946. [PAR] Did You Know?

While there she studied chemistry and joined the Oxford Union Conservative Association, becoming president of the organization in 1946. After graduation she worked as a research chemist, but her real interest was politics. In 1950 she ran for parliament in the Labour-dominated constituency of Dartford, using the slogan \u201cVote Right to Keep What\u2019s Left.\u201d She lost that year and again in 1951, but received more votes than previous Conservative Party candidates.

Meanwhile, she was studying for the bar exams, which she passed in early 1954. She then spent the next few years practicing law and looking for a winnable constituency. [PAR] Thatcher ran for parliament once more in 1959\u2014this time in the Conservative-dominated constituency of Finchley\u2014and easily won the seat. The first bill she introduced affirmed the right of the media to cover local government meetings. Speaking about the bill in her maiden speech, she focused not on freedom of the press but instead on the need to limit wasteful government expenditures\u2014a common theme throughout her political career. [PAR] By 1961 Thatcher had accepted an invitation to become parliamentary undersecretary in the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. She then steadily moved up the ministerial ranks, becoming secretary of state for education and science when the Conservatives retook power in 1970. The following year she was demonized by her Labour Party opponents as \u201cThatcher the milk snatcher\u201d when she eliminated a free milk program for schoolchildren. Nonetheless, she was able to keep her job, and in 1975, with the Conservatives back in the opposition, she defeated former Prime Minister Edward Heath to take over leadership of the party.

Bono and U2 drummer Larry Mullen Jr. were both there with their families \u2013 in fact, it was Elvis Mullen\u2019s tenth birthday that weekend, and a barbecue was planned at the house Bono had rented on the beach, where he, his wife of twenty-three years, Ali, and their four children were staying.

Photograph: The Kobal Collection/www.picture-desk.com [PAR] Friday 23 July 2010 19.06\u00a0EDT [PAR] First published on Friday 23 July 2010 19.06\u00a0EDT [PAR] Share on Messenger [PAR] Close [PAR] \"What do you think spies are: priests, saints, martyrs? They're a squalid procession of vain fools, traitors, too, yes; pansies, sadists and drunkards, people who play cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten lives.\" The person responsible for this bitter rant is Alec Leamas, the deadpan fiftysomething protagonist of John le Carr\u00e9's 1963 novel The Spy Who Came In From the Cold. We will refer to it as The Spy from now on, for brevity's sake, but it's worth starting any current assessment of the novel with something of a thought-experiment. The Spy is set in the early 1960s before the assassination of John F Kennedy, before the real advent of hippies, the pill, the Vietnam war, the \"swinging sixties\" and all the familiar counter-cultural baggage that goes with it. Its tone, if anything, is dourly 1950s, its colours grey, its weather depressing. It's worth remembering that rationing in Britain finally ended in 1954; that the second world war was a fresh memory (Leamas is a veteran); indeed, that anyone in their 70s would be a survivor of the 1914\u201318 war, the first world war. The action of the novel takes place half a century ago. It belongs to an entirely different world from the one we know today. [PAR] And yet, and perhaps this is the first remarkable comment to make about The Spy, its cynicism is resolutely de nos jours. One forgets just how unsparing the book is, how the picture it paints of human motivations, human duplicities, human frailty seems presciently aware of all that we have learned and unlearned in the intervening decades. The world was, on the surface, a more innocent, more straightforward place in the early 1960s: there were good guys and bad guys and they were easy to spot. One of the shock effects of reading The Spy when it was published must have been the near-nihilism of its message. It is unremittingly dark \u2013 or almost so \u2013 and this fact, I believe, lies at the root of its greatness. [PAR] The Spy is the story, to put it very simply, of a complicated act of deadly triple-bluff perpetrated by the British Secret Service against its enemies in the German Democratic Republic, as communist East Germany was then known. At its centre is Alec Leamas, sent, he believes, on a clever under-cover mission of revenge but in fact the unwitting tool of even cleverer British brains with other motives. So much so relatively straightforward, but one of the sheer pleasures of the grade one espionage novel is in unravelling its multifarious complexities and Le Carr\u00e9 handles the unspooling web of narrative and motive with exemplary poise. [PAR] The second remarkable aspect of The Spy is the skill with which it is constructed and written. It was Le Carr\u00e9's third novel (after the highly creditable Call for the Dead and A Murder of Quality) but there is a clear sense in The Spy of a writer hitting his stride with resolute confidence. Unusually for a spy novel, Le Carr\u00e9's narrative point of view is omniscient \u2013 a dangerous choice, because with authorial omniscience you cannot have your cake and eat it. If you are saying to the reader that you can enter the thoughts of any character and can comment on the action or events in your own voice, then any deliberate withholding of information counts as a black mark.

The Danish flag is among the oldest used national flag in the world. The use of the flag dates back to the thirteenth century when the Battle of Valdemar was fought. The battle was fought by the Danes to defeat Estonia and establish Danish administration in the country. After an unsuccessful struggle, the Danes were about to surrender. At the time a flag fell from the sky on June 15, 1219. The flag was believed to have been God's gift and was named Danneberg. Since then, the flag has been used as the official flag of the Danish Empire. Every year on June 15, the Danish flag is hoisted to commemorate the anniversary of the Battle of Valdemar.

He was celebrated for his beauty and attracted many admirers but, in his arrogance,  spurned them all. The suffering of two of these, however, would bring down a curse upon him. [PAR] The nymphe Ekho (Echo) --a girl cursed by Hera to repeat only the last words of what was said before--was rejected by the boy and fading away in despair left behind nothing but an echoing voice. [PAR] The other admirer was the youth Ameinias who became  distraught when Narkissos cruelly spurned him. He killed himself before his beloved's door,  calling on the goddess Nemesis to avenge him. His prayer was answered when Narkissos fell in love with his own reflection in a pool. Gazing endlessly at the image, he slowly pined away  and was transformed by the nymphs into a narcissus flower. Others say he was  instead filled with remorse and  killed himself beside the pool--and from his dying life's blood the flower was born. [PAR] Narkissos' name was the ancient Greek word for the narcissus or daffodil flower. The boy's mother Leiriope was named after another species of daffodil--the leirion--and his spurned love Ameinias   for the ameinasis. According to Hesychius s.v., ameinasis was another name for the sweet-smelling herb duosmon--either dill, anise or cummin. Presumably these two were also transformed into their namesake plants. Such a group of sympathetic metamorphoses is not uncommon in Greek myth.

He was a very handsome youth, but wholly inaccessible to the feeling of love. The nymph Echo, who loved him, but in vain, died away with grief. One of his rejected lovers, however, prayed to Nemesis to punish him for his unfeeling heart. Nemesis accordingly caused Narcissus to see his own face reflected in a well, and to fall in love with his own image. As this shadow was unapproachable Narcissus gradually perished with love, and his corpse was metamorphosed into the flower called after him narcissus. This beautiful story is related at length by Ovid (Met. iii. 341, &c.). According to some traditions, Narcissus sent a sword to one of his lovers, Ameinias, who killed himself with it at the very door of Narcissus' house, and called upon the gods to avenge his death. Narcissus, tormented by love of himself and by repentance, put an end to his life, and from his blood there sprang up the flower narcissus (Conon, Narrat. 24). Other accounts again state that Narcissus melted away into the well in which he had beheld his own image (Paus. ix. 31. \u00a7 6); or that he had a beloved twin sister perfectly like him, who died, whereupon he looked at his own image reflected in a well, to satify his longing after his sister.

The battle of Vimy Ridge, which was part of the larger battle of Arras in northern France, began on Easter Monday, which was April 9, in 1917. About 30,000 Canadians fought at Vimy Ridge and claimed victory. However, this victory came at a high cost. The Canadians suffered about 11,000 casualties. Of these, nearly 3,600 Canadians were killed. [PAR] At Vimy, regiments from coast to coast saw action together in a distinctly Canadian triumph, helping create a new and stronger sense of Canadian identity. After Vimy, the Canadian corps never looked back, and its success raised Canada\u2019s international stature and earned a separate signature on the Treaty of Versailles that ended the war.

They are identified by some historians as \"a distinct breed and type as long ago as 329 B.C. when Alexander the Great invaded India.\" Earliest known carvings look more like Salukis than any other breed: they have a Greyhound body with feathered ears, tail and legs. [PAR] This same exact hound also appears on the Egyptian tombs of 2100 B.C. and again in more recent excavations of the Sumerian empire, estimated at 7000-6000 B.C. The Saluki was so esteemed that his body was often mummified like the bodies of the Pharaohs themselves. [PAR] The remains of numerous specimens have thus been found in the ancient tombs of the Upper Nile region. [PAR] As the desert tribes were nomadic, the habitat of the Saluki comprised the entire region from the Caspian Sea to the Sahara. Naturally the types varied somewhat in this widely scattered area-mostly in size and coat. [PAR] Salukis were first brought into England in 1840 and were known as Persian Greyhounds. [PAR] There was no real interest until the Hon. Florence Amherst imported the first Arabian Saluki in 1895 from the kennels of Prince Abdulla in Transjordania. [PAR] Having tremendous speed, the Saluki was used by Arabs principally in bringing down the gazelle. In England, the dog was used largely on hares. [PAR] Regular coursing meets are held with judging based on ability to turn quickly and over take the hare in the best possible time. The Saluki hunts largely by sight although he has a fair nose. [PAR] The Saluki was a well-established breed in England for a number of years before he began to come into his own in this country.

This type of hound works alone, not with a handler\u2014even an Olympic sprinter couldn\u2019t keep up running alongside a Saluki\u2014and this accounts for the breed\u2019s independent nature.

He started his career as a soldier and war correspondent in the British Army during the Cuban War for Independence and Boer War. He first won a seat in Parliament in 1900 as a member of the Conservative Party, but switched to the Labor Party in 1904. In 1911 he was appointed to the position of First Lord of the Admiralty, which he kept until 1915 when he left to command a batallion in World War I. After holding several political offices and running unsuccessfully for several others, he rejoined the Conservative Party in 1925. He was appointed Chancelor of the Exchequer in 1924 and oversaw unpopular policies, including returning to the gold standard, and became alienated from Conservative leadership. In the 1930s he rose to prominence for speaking out against Germany's rearmament and urging England to take action against Germany's aggression. When World War II broke out, he was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty again. In 1940 Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who had followed a policy of appeasing Hitler , resigned, and Chamberlain, King George VI, and other politicians chose Churchill as a replacement. As Prime Minister, he refused to sign an armistice with Germany, and he led his people through the 1940 Battle of Britain, during which German planes kept up a sustained attack on Britain for several months. His speeches were inspirational to many people. As the leaders of the three major Allied Powers, Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt , and Joseph Stalin became known as the \"Big Three.\" By 1945 the Allies had won the war, but Churchill was defeated in the election that year.

[PAR] Cinder cones [PAR] Cinder cones are the simplest type of volcano. They are built from particles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinders around the vent to form a circular or oval cone. Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit and rarely rise more than a thousand feet or so above their surroundings. Cinder cones are numerous in western North America as well as throughout other volcanic terrains of the world. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] \u00a0Schematic representation of the internal structure of a typical cinder cone. [PAR] In 1943 a cinder cone started growing on a farm near the village of Par\u00edcutin in Mexico. Explosive eruptions caused by gas rapidly expanding and escaping from molten lava formed cinders that fell back around the vent, building up the cone to a height of 1,200 feet. The last explosive eruption left a funnel-shaped crater at the top of the cone. After the excess gases had largely dissipated, the molten rock quietly poured out on the surrounding surface of the cone and moved downslope as lava flows. This order of events--eruption, formation of cone and crater, lava flow--is a common sequence in the formation of cinder cones. [PAR] During 9 years of activity, Par\u00edcutin built a prominent cone, covered about 100 square miles with ashes, and destroyed the town of San Juan. Geologists from many parts of the world studied Par\u00edcutin during its lifetime and learned a great deal about volcanism, its products, and the modification of a volcanic landform by erosion. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] \u00a0Par\u00edcutin Volcano, Mexico, is a cinder cone rising approximately 1,200 feet above the surrounding plain. [PAR] Composite volcanoes [PAR] Some of the Earth's grandest mountains are composite volcanoes--sometimes called stratovolcanoes. They are typically steep-sided, symmetrical cones of large dimension built of alternating layers of lava flows, volcanic ash, cinders, blocks, and bombs and may rise as much as 8,000 feet above their bases. Some of the most conspicuous and beautiful mountains in the world are composite volcanoes, including Mount Fuji in Japan, Mount Cotopaxi in Ecuador, Mount Shasta in California, Mount Hood in Oregon, and Mount St. Helens and Mount Rainier in Washington. [PAR] Most composite volcanoes have a crater at the summit which contains a central vent or a clustered group of vents. Lavas either flow through breaks in the crater wall or issue from fissures on the flanks of the cone. Lava, solidified within the fissures, forms dikes that act as ribs which greatly strengthen the cone. [PAR] The essential feature of a composite volcano is a conduit system through which magma from a reservoir deep in the Earth's crust rises to the surface. The volcano is built up by the accumulation of material erupted through the conduit and increases in size as lava, cinders, ash, etc., are added to its slopes. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] \u00a0Schematic representation of the internal structue of a typical composite volcano. [PAR] When a composite volcano becomes dormant, erosion begins to destroy the cone. As the cone is stripped away, the hardened magma filling the conduit (the volcanic plug) and fissures (the dikes) becomes exposed, and it too is slowly reduced by erosion. Finally, all that remains is the plug and dike complex projecting above the land surface--a telltale remnant of the vanished volcano. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] \u00a0Shishaldin Volcano, an imposing composite cone, towers 9,372 feet above sea level in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska. [PAR] An interesting variation of a composite volcano can be seen at Crater Lake in Oregon. From what geologists can interpret of its past, a high volcano--called Mount Mazama- probably similar in appearance to present-day Mount Rainier was once located at this spot.

[PAR] Peter Paul Rubens arguably is the most famous Flemish painter. Born in 1577 in Germany from Flemish parents, he moved to Antwerp with his mother in 1589. During his youth he studied Latin and classic literature, and painting under Antwerp's leading painters of the time. [PAR] During early adulthood Rubens travelled to Italy where the studied and became influenced by the Italian masters of the time.   In 1609 he came back to Antwerp. At the time Antwerp started to prosper again, with a recent truce established in the armed conflicts between Habsburg Spain (occupying the Southern Netherlands or present day Flanders) and the Dutch Republic to the north. [PAR] Self-portrait by Peter Paul Rubens - Rubenshuis Museum, Antwerp. [PAR] Rubens moved into a new house with studio that he designed himself. This house is now known as the Rubenshuis Museum, off the main shopping street of Antwerp (the Meir), and located in the Wapper street. Rubens had many apprentices, working in his studio, including the young Anthony Van Dyck.     It is during that time, that the two altarpieces now in the Cathedral of our Lady in Antwerp, were produced. [PAR] Interesting is that Rubens made good use of the distribution facilities of the time, by producing many prints of his works, for distribution in Europe. He even established copyrights for his prints. [PAR] Rubens left Antwerp again in 1621, living in France, England and Spain. He was also active as a diplomat, entrusted by the Spanish Habsburg rulers with diplomatic missions.          As a result op these travels, a lot of the paintings of this period are now in various European museums.         However, the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (1625-1626) was painted for the Cathedral of Antwerp.          Rubens eventually came back to Antwerp in the last decade of his life (1630-1640), and in 1630 at age 53, he married his second wife, the 16-year old Helene Fourment, who reportedly became one of his most favoured models during the latter days of his life. [PAR] Peter Paul  Rubens was a prolific artist. He also co-produced lots of art work with his apprentices and fellow painters. On top of that, he was an active art designer. His paintings are now famed for the depiction of voluptuous women, so much so that the term 'Rubenesque' is to this day used for somewhat over-sized females. To be sure, also the males in many of his religious paintings, are oversized, and not exactly by an abundance of muscles. [PAR] Last time I checked, a painting of Rubens, 'Massacre of the Innocents', still holds the record as the most expensive painting by an old master, sold at auction (Sotheby's, 49.5 million Pounds). (Nowadays, a lot of more recent work, goes for higher prices). [PAR] Rubens in Antwerp : [PAR] 1.

It is now an international event that literally stops a nation shortly before 3pm on the first Tuesday in November every year.

[PAR] A famous Australian [PAR] Another fond memory\u00a0associated with Australian horse racing\u00a0that many Australians have is of one of its most famous horses and Melbourne Cup winner by the name\u00a0of Phar Lap. He was known as \"Australia's wonder horse\" and was a champion thoroughbred that had a successful career in Australian horse racing. [PAR] Born in 1926 in New Zealand, his name was chosen from a derivation of the Zhuang and Thai word for lightning, literally translated as 'sky flash.' [PAR] In the four years of his racing career, Phar Lap won 37 of the 51 races he entered, including the Melbourne Cup in 1930. As his success grew, there were some who tried to destroy him. Only days before his Melbourne Cup win there was an attempted shooting of the champion horse, narrowly missing him. That same day he won the Melbourne Stakes and three days later the Melbourne Cup.\u00a0 [PAR] Two years later on 5th April, the horse's strapper found him in severe pain and with a high temperature. A few hours later, Phar Lap haemorrhaged (bled) to death. An autopsy was inconclusive but many believed that he was deliberately poisoned. There have been alternative theories about his death including accidental poisoning, an acute bacterial infection and a stomach condition. Over eight decades later, mystery still surrounds Phar Lap's death and there was a forensic investigation as recently as 2008 where large amounts of arsenic were found in a sample of Phar Lap's mane, possibly supporting the theory that he was killed on the orders of U.S. gangsters. However, there has been no real evidence of criminal involvement. [PAR] Phar Lap's heart [PAR] Another interesting fact about Phar Lap was the size of his heart which weighed 6.2 kg compared with a normal horse's heart at 3.2kg.

While his parched and effeminate falsetto recalls Gasoline Alley -era Rod Stewart with a healthy dose of Antony and the Johnsons , it's the late Elliott Smith who casts the largest shadow on Back to Bedlam . Predictable but effective four-chord guitar motifs are the chosen vehicle for the ex-Royal Armed Forces soldier, and when they connect (\"Wiseman,\" \"Goodbye My Lover,\" \"You Are Beautiful\"), it's like a \"Dear John\" letter from a lover who you know will remain a close but ultimately guarded friend. Opening track \"High\" sets a determined midtempo pace that rarely wanes -- it's like an acoustic version of \"Drive\" by the Cars with a Coldplay chorus. It's a pace that would sink some records, but Bedlam 's perfectly rendered, under 40-minute run time ensures that the listener doesn't suffer from a melancholy overdose. Blunt recounts his harrowing experiences as part of the NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo on the closer, \"No Bravery,\" and it's a shock to hear all of the romantic lyricism that informed Bedlam up to this point reduced to \"Old men kneel and accept their fate/Wives and daughters cut and raped/A generation drenched in hate,\" but it's damn effective -- as is the majority of this fine debut.

Most notably, she danced professionally with Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, later establishing The Royal Ballet, one of the foremost ballet companies of the 20th century and one of the leading ballet companies in the world today. She also established the Birmingham Royal Ballet and Royal Ballet School. She is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of ballet and as the 'godmother' of English ballet. [PAR] Biography [PAR] Ninette de Valois was born Edris Stannus on 6 June 1898, near the town of Blessington, County Wicklow, Ireland. She was the second daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Stannus DSO, a British Army officer, and Lillith Graydon-Smith, a distinguished glassmaker. She moved to England in 1905, where she lived with her grandmother in Kent. [PAR] De Valois started attending ballet lessons in 1908 at the age of 10. At the age of 13, she began her professional training at the Lila Field Academy for Children. It was at this time that she legally changed her name to Ninette de Valois and made her professional debut as a principal dancer in pantomime at the Lyceum Theatre in the West End. In 1919, at the age of 21, she was appointed principal dancer of the Beecham Opera, which was then the resident opera company at the Royal Opera House. She continued to study ballet with notable teachers, including Edouard Espinosa, Enrico Cecchetti and Nicholas Legat. [PAR] In 1923, de Valois joined the Ballets Russes, a renowned ballet company founded by the Russian impresario Sergei Diaghilev. She remained with the company for three years, being promoted to the rank of Soloist, and creating roles in some of the company's most famous ballets, including Les biches and Le Train Bleu. During this time, she was also mentor to Alicia Markova who was only a child at the time, but would eventually be recognised as a Prima Ballerina Assoluta and one of the most famous English dancers of all time. Later in her life, de Valois claimed that everything she knew about how to run a ballet company, she learned from working with Diaghilev. [PAR] After leaving the Ballets Russes, in 1927, de Valois established the Academy of Choreographic Art, a dance school for girls. Her ultimate goal was to form a repertory ballet company, with dancers drawn from the school and trained in a uniquely British style of ballet. Students of the school were given professional stage experience performing in opera and plays staged at the Old Vic Theatre, with de Valois choreographing several short ballets for the theatre. Lilian Baylis was the owner of the Old Vic at that time, and in 1928 she also acquired and refurbished the Sadler's Wells Theatre, with the intention of creating a sister theatre to the Old Vic. She employed de Valois to stage full scale dance productions at both theatres and when the Sadler's Wells theatre re-opened in 1931, de Valois moved her school into studios there, under the new name, the Sadler's Wells Ballet School. A ballet company was also formed, known as the Vic-Wells Ballet. The Vic-Wells ballet company and school would be the predecessors of today's Royal Ballet, Birmingham Royal Ballet and Royal Ballet School. [PAR] Vic-Wells Ballet [PAR] At its formation, the Vic-Wells ballet had only six female dancers, with de Valois herself working as lead dancer and choreographer. The company performed its first full ballet production on 5 May 1931 at the Old Vic, with Anton Dolin as guest star. Its first performance at Sadler's Wells, was on 15 May 1931. As a result of the success of the ballet company, de Valois hired new dancers and choreographers to work with the company. She retired from the stage herself after Alicia Markova joined the company and was appointed Prima Ballerina\n\n\n### Answer:\nroyal ballet </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

It was Long's idea for the            state to construct a new building for the statehouse in 1928 when he            was running for Governor of the State of Louisiana. The construction            of the building was part of his political platform, as well as the notion            to place the state capitol on the site, which was once Louisiana            State University and formerly a military post known as the Pentagon            Barracks . Included was a strip of land on which the Arsenal Museum            was located. Long had contracted with a New Orleans architectural firm,            Weiss, Dreyfous and Seiferth, to design the building. Next, Governor            Long had pushed through an amendment which financed the new capitol            by the end of the 1930 Legislative Section. Within 36 days of the completion            of the final design, actual construction by the George A. Fuller Company            of Washington, D.C. had begun. The construction work took 29 months            to complete and the dedication was coordinated with the inauguration            of Oscar K. Allen as Governor on May 16, 1932. Ironically, Long was            not present because he had been elected to the U.S. Senate and was in            Washington, D.C.

Gilbert Proesch (b Dolomites, Italy, 17 Sept 1943) and George Passmore (b Plymouth, Devon, 8 Jan 1942) met in 1967 as students at St Martin's School of Art in London. By 1969 they were reacting against approaches to sculpture then dominant at St Martin's, which they regarded as elitist and poor at communicating outside an art context. Their strategy was to make themselves into sculpture, so sacrificing their separate identities to art and turning the notion of creativity on its head. [PAR] Although working in a variety of media, Gilbert and George referred to all their work as sculpture. Between 1970 and 1974 they also made drawings (referred to as Charcoal on Paper Sculptures) and paintings to give a more tangible form to their identity as \u2018living sculptures' [PAR] In 1971 Gilbert & George made their first \u2018photo-pieces', which remained their dominant form of expression. They gradually shifted the emphasis of their subject-matter away from their own experiences of life. Instead they concentrated on the inner-city reality that confronted them on the street and on the structures and feelings that inform life such as religion, class, royalty, sex, hope, nationality, death, identity, politics and fear. Their belief that they are making an \u2018Art for Life's Sake' and an \u2018Art for All' was, at the beginning of the 1990s, given a renewed emphasis through their exhibitions mounted in Moscow (1990), Beijing and Shanghai (1993).

Originally known for its eponymous Bacardi white rum, it now has a portfolio of more than 200 brands and labels.  Founded in 1862, and family-owned for seven generations, Bacardi employs 6,000 people, manufactures at 27 facilities in 16 markets on four continents, with sales in more than 150 countries. Bacardi Limited refers to the Bacardi group of companies, including Bacardi International Limited.  The company sells in excess of 200 million bottles per year.  The company's sales in 2007 were US$5.5\u00a0billion, up from $4.9\u00a0billion in 2006. [PAR] Bacardi Limited is headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda, and has a 16-member board of directors led by the original founder's great-great grandson, Facundo L. Bacard\u00ed.  Along with other leading alcohol producers, Bacardi is part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.[5] [PAR] History [PAR] Early history [PAR] Facundo Bacard\u00ed Mass\u00f3, a Spanish wine merchant, was born in Sitges, Catalonia, Spain, in 1814, and emigrated to Cuba in 1830. During this period, rum was cheaply made and not considered a refined drink, and rarely sold in upmarket taverns. Facundo began attempting to \"tame\" rum by isolating a proprietary strain of yeast still used in Bacardi production.  This yeast gives Bacardi rum its flavour profile. After experimenting with several techniques he hit upon filtering the rum through charcoal, which removed impurities. In addition to this, Facundo aged the rum in white oak barrels, which had the effect of mellowing the drink. The final product was the first clear, or \"white\" rum in the world. [PAR] Moving from the experimental stage to a more commercial endeavour, he and his brother Jos\u00e9 set up a Santiago de Cuba distillery they bought in 1862, which housed a still made of copper and cast iron. In the rafters of this building lived fruit bats\u00a0\u2013 the inspiration for the Bacardi bat logo.  [PAR] The 1880s and 90s were turbulent times for Cuba and the company. Emilio Bacardi, Don Facundo's eldest son, was repeatedly imprisoned and was exiled from Cuba for having fought in the rebel army against Spain in the Cuban War of Independence.  [PAR] Emilio's brothers, Facundo and Jos\u00e9, and his brother-in-law Henri (Don Enrique) Schueg, remained in Cuba with the difficult task of sustaining the company during a period of war. The women in the family were exiled in Kingston, Jamaica. After the Cuban War of Independence and the US occupation of Cuba, \"The Original Cuba Libre\" and the Daiquiri were both created, using Bacardi rum.  In 1899 US General Leonard Wood appointed Emilio Bacardi Mayor of Santiago de Cuba. [PAR] In 1912, Emilio Bacardi travelled to Egypt, where he purchased a mummy (still on display) for the future Emilio Bacardi Moreau Municipal Museum in Santiago de Cuba. In Santiago, his brother Facundo M. Bacard\u00ed continued to manage the company along with Schueg, who began the company's international expansion by opening bottling plants in Barcelona (1910) and New York City (1915).  The New York plant was soon shut down due to Prohibition, yet during this time Cuba became a hotspot for US tourists. [PAR] In 1922 Emilio opened a new distillery in Santiago. In 1930 Schueg opened the Art Deco Bacardi building in Havana and the third generation of the Bacard\u00ed family entered the business. Facundito Bacard\u00ed was known to have invited Americans (still subject to Prohibition) to \"Come to Cuba and bathe in Bacardi rum.\" A new product was introduced: Hatuey beer. [PAR] Bacardi's transition into an international brand was due mostly to Schueg's \"business genius\"; Schueg \"branded Cuba as the home of rum, and Bacardi as the king of rums\" and expanded overseas, first to Mexico (1931), then to Puerto Rico (1936), under the brand name Ron Bacardi. (Ron is the Spanish word for rum). Post-Prohibition production in Puerto Rico enabled rum to be sold tariff-free in the US.

Our guide to the history gives you the facts & information you wa [PAR] The storming of the Bastille prison on July 14th 1789 was an event that paved the way to further civil disorder and upheaval in France. It is from here on that the revolution took on a snowball effect slowly spilling over the whole of France and transforming what was till then an oppressive monarchist regime. An ironic discovery that was made was the entry in King Louis XVI\u2019s diary for that particular date. In the comfort of his Palace at the Versailles he was unaware of the impact of the events that were taking place in Paris and the effects that they would have on the future course of the country\u2019s fate he wrote \u201cJuly 14th; nothing\u201d. [PAR] Storming of the Bastille 1789 [PAR] This day is seen by many as the symbol of the French revolution and is to date a public holiday in memory of the revolution. Bastille was a huge structure which was previously a castle building with eight towers. It was situated in the East of Paris in the working class district of St Antoine. There were various rumors being floated around Paris that created a hype which led to the people storming the Bastille. There was a constant threat from bandits, outlaws and evil aristocrats who were known to have been starving people. The King too was suspected for planning and preparing for a violent suppression of the French Public through the use of the military. The final straw was when the King stripped the Necker of his ministry as he was popular amongst the people. This was done on the 12th of July and from here on the public was colored with the spirit of rebellion. [PAR] Storming of the Bastille Weapons [PAR] When the King had called the three estates to come to a tax resolution the third estate that was the only tax paying class and consisted of the vast majority of the public and declared itself independent. It formed a committee that was to run the state affairs and act as a civic militia to maintain order. With a few canons and around 3,000 rifles under their possession the mobs decided to storm into the Bastille in the hope of finding more arms. The Bastille palace was being used as a prison at that time with Marquis de Launay as its head. It was known to have been weakly guarded with only 30 Swiss guards and 85 invalides. The head of the prison tried to reach to some sort of a middle ground with the angry mob and he even agreed to pull back the canons that were positioned up high. [PAR] Peasants & the Storming of the Bastille [PAR] An unwise decision on the part of De Luanay was to let the mob into the courtyard. Soon after a few gun shots triggered a chaotic crossfire which resulted in a blood bath inside the prison courtyard. In this period of four hours it was seen that many of the prison defenders changed sides and started fighting from the revolutionaries\u2019 side. Eventually the fighting ended and de Launay and his men were taken to Town Hall and murdered and their heads were put up on posts and paraded around the city. At the news of the storming of the Bastille the king was forced to reinstate the Necker and depose the troops near the capital. It was at this moment that the red, white and blue cocard was crowned as the symbol of France.[DOC] [TLE] The Storming of the Bastille: HistoryWiz French RevolutionThe Storming of the Bastille: HistoryWiz French Revolution [PAR] by                Hans-Jurgen Lusebrink [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] The Bastille was a medieval fortress with 8 towers, which at the time of the French Revolution housed only a few common criminals.

October 19]\u00a01735\u00a0\u2013 July 4, 1826) was an American lawyer, author, statesman, and diplomat. He served as the second President of the United States (1797\u20131801), the first Vice President (1789\u201397),  and as a Founding Father was a leader of American independence from Great Britain.  Adams was a political theorist in the Age of Enlightenment who promoted republicanism and a strong central government. His innovative ideas were frequently published. He was also a dedicated diarist and correspondent, particularly with his wife and key advisor Abigail. [PAR] He collaborated with his cousin, revolutionary leader Samuel Adams, but he established his own prominence prior to the American Revolution. After the Boston Massacre, despite severe local anti-British sentiment, he provided a successful though unpopular legal defense of the accused British soldiers, driven by his devotion to the right to counsel and the Presumption of innocence|\"protect[ion] of innocence\".  As a delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental Congress, Adams played a leading role in persuading Congress to declare independence. He assisted Thomas Jefferson in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and was its foremost advocate in the Congress. As a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate the eventual peace treaty with Great Britain, and acquired vital governmental loans from Amsterdam bankers. Adams was the primary author of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780 which influenced American political theory, as did his earlier Thoughts on Government (1776). [PAR] Adams' credentials as a revolutionary secured for him two terms as President George Washington's vice president (1789 to 1797) and also his own election in 1796 as the second president. In his single term as president, he encountered fierce criticism from the Jeffersonian Republicans, as well as the dominant faction in his own Federalist Party, led by his rival Alexander Hamilton. Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts, and built up the army and navy in the face of an undeclared naval \"Quasi-War\" with France. The major accomplishment of his presidency was a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the face of Hamilton's opposition. Due to his strong posture on defense, Adams is \"often called the father of the American Navy\".  He was the first U.S. president to reside in the executive mansion, now known as the White House.  [PAR] In 1800, Adams lost re-election to Thomas Jefferson, and retired to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed his friendship with Jefferson upon the latter's own retirement by initiating a correspondence which lasted fourteen years.  He and his wife established a family of politicians, diplomats, and historians now referred to as the Adams political family. Adams was the father of John Quincy Adams, the sixth President of the United States. He died on the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. Modern historians in the aggregate have ranked his administration favorably. [PAR] Early life and education [PAR] Childhood [PAR] John Adams was born on October 30, 1735 (October 19, 1735 Old Style, Julian calendar), to John Adams Sr. (1691\u20131761) and Susanna Boylston (1708\u20131797). He had two younger brothers, Peter and Elihu. Adams' birthplace was then in Braintree, Massachusetts (now Quincy, Massachusetts), and is preserved at Adams National Historical Park. Adams' mother was from a leading medical family of current Brookline, Massachusetts.  His father was a Congregationalist deacon, a farmer, a cordwainer, and a lieutenant in the militia. He further served as a selectman (town councilman) and supervised the building of schools and roads. Adams often praised his father and recalled their close relationship. His paternal great-grandfather David Adams was born and bred at \"Fferm Penybanc\", Llanboidy, Carmarthenshire, North Wales.  He emigrated from Wales in 1675 and sixty years later his great-grandson, John Adams, was born.    [PAR] Though raised in modest surroundings, Adams felt an acute responsibility to live up to his family's heritage of reverence.

For those who are unfamiliar with Thackeray\u2019s classic novel, it is subtitled \u201cA Novel without a Hero\u201d, and satirizes English society circa 1815. It may be of interest to those of us who cut our teeth on Regency-era romances; Vanity Fair presents a somewhat jaundiced view of the British upper classes of the time. [PAR] Becky Sharp completes her studies at Miss Pinkerton\u2019s Academy, studies that were subsidized first by her artist father\u2019s teaching at the school and later, after he dies, by her own teaching of French to the pupils. She leaves the school to stay with her good friend Amelia Sedley, who finishes matriculating at the same time. Becky needs to go into service and she has a position secured, but first she will spend some time with Amelia in the comfortably prosperous atmosphere of the Sedley household. [PAR] There, Becky meets Jos Sedley, Amelia\u2019s brother, who is visiting, having made his fortune in India. Jos is fat and shy, especially around women, but also vain and given to cultivating and believing ridiculous puffery about himself and his exploits (after Waterloo he seemingly believes he was a vital part of the British victory, in spite of the fact that he spent the entire battle in town, desperately trying to flee to safer environs). [PAR] Becky sets her sights on Jos, believing he will offer for her and save her from a life of drudgery. But she\u2019s not able to reel him in before being forced to depart for Queen\u2019s Crawley to work as a governess for Sir Pitt Crawley, a baronet who is a nobleman in name only. Sir Pitt is crude and Queen\u2019s Crawley is dirty and depressing, but Becky manages to do what she does best \u2013 charm and ingratiate herself with anyone who is capable of being charmed and willing to be ingratiated. She quickly has Sir Pitt eating out of her hand, and when she meets Sir Pitt\u2019s wealthy relative Miss Crawley, Becky becomes fast friends with the old lady. The entire Crawley family fawns over Miss Crawley in hopes of gaining her inheritance, though Rawdon Crawley, Sir Pitt\u2019s younger son, has long been her favorite and presumptive heir. [PAR] Positions in the Crawley family are thrown into disarray, however, after Sir Pitt Crawley\u2019s mousy wife dies. This prompts Sir Pitt to propose marriage to Becky, only to find that she cannot marry him, as she is already secretly married to his son Rawdon. The secret and, some would say, unsuitable marriage (Becky\u2019s mother was an opera dancer, after all) infuriates the entire Crawley family, none more than Miss Crawley. Rawdon was her favorite and she adored Becky for her ability to amuse (usually by cruel\u00a0mockery\u00a0of others \u2013 Becky knows how to tailor her talents to her audience), but Miss Crawley is at heart a snob and feels betrayed by both parties after the elopement. Rawdon is promptly cut off by his father and dropped from Miss Crawley\u2019s will; all of Becky and Rawdon\u2019s attempts to reingratiate themselves with Miss Crawley fail (in no small part to the machinations of other family members who are scheming to get their hands on the money, as well). [PAR] Becky reunites with her friend Amelia after marriage; Amelia has \u00a0married under somewhat similar circumstances.\u00a0Amelia had long been betrothed to George Osborne, son of her father\u2019s business partner. But when Mr. Sedley undergoes a disastrous financial reversal, his old friend Osborne immediately turns on him and orders George to drop Amelia. George only demurs due to the very strong influence of his friend and fellow Army officer, William Dobbin. Dobbin is in love with Amelia himself, so in love that he selflessly wants her to have everything she wants, and she wants George.

There is an interior courtyard and, in the back, a terrace overlooking a garden of 0.5 acres (2,000\u00a0m2). Adjacent to St. James's Park, Number 10 is near to Buckingham Palace, the official London residence of the British monarch, and the Palace of Westminster, the meeting place of both houses of parliament.  Originally three houses, Number 10 was offered to Sir Robert Walpole by George II in 1732. Walpole accepted on the condition that they be a gift to the office of First Lord of the Treasury rather than to him personally. Walpole commissioned William Kent to join the three houses together . It is this larger house that is known today as \"Number 10 Downing Street\".  The arrangement was not an immediate success. Despite its size and convenient location near to Parliament, few early Prime Ministers lived there. Costly to maintain, neglected, and run-down, Number 10 was close to being razed several times.

Audio file courtesy of the Acoustic Atlas at Montana State University (www.acousticatlas.org) [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] General Description [PAR] The Uinta Chipmunk is a medium-sized chipmunk, with moderately distinct dorsal stripes and generally warm brownish pelage on the flanks, shoulders, and head. In some regions they may be difficult to distinguish from other chipmunk species by sight. The outermost stripe is white bordered by brown, not black. It is more likely to be seen in trees than other chipmunks sharing its range (Bergstrom 1999). Adults may attain the following body measurements: total length 200 to 243 millimeters; tail length 90 to 115 millimeters; hind foot 30 to 35 millimeters; ear 16 to 19 millimeters; weight 55 to 80 grams. Sexes are similar in size (Clark and Stromberg 1987). There are 22 teeth in the skull (dental formula: I 1/1, C 0/0, P 2/1, M 3/3), and the skull is more than 34 millimeters in length. [PAR] Diagnostic Characteristics [PAR] In Montana, the Uinta Chipmunk is sympatric only with the Least and Yellow-pine Chipmunks, and is larger than both. The outermost light dorsal stripe is white (not grayish or yellowish) and bordered by brown, not black as with other species; similarly all of the central dark dorsal stripes are brownish-black, not black as in the other Montana chipmunks. Unlike the Least Chipmunk, it tends to hold its tail horizontally rather than vertically when running, and is generally darker brownish rather than washed grayish or yellowish. Unlike the Yellow-pine Chipmunk, the belly is whitish. Gray-brown coloration on the face and head separate it from the Red-tailed Chipmunk, which is reddish in those body areas and does not occupy the same part of the state (Foresman 2012).

The species is known elsewhere to be non-migratory; apparently only local movements are made. In Colorado, minimum convex polygon home ranges of radio-tracked individuals were 1.87 to 5.12 hectares, and home range lengths were 179 to 457 meters (Bergstrom 1988). [PAR] Habitat [PAR] Habitat use in Montana is unstudied and poorly described. The Uinta Chipmunk is found at high elevation in Carbon and southeastern Park Counties in subalpine forest and at treeline in krummholz vegetation, presumably subalpine fir-Engelmann spruce-whitebark pine (Pattie and Verbeek 1967). [PAR] Elsewhere, Uinta Chipmunks are known to frequent coniferous forests at moderate to high elevations (to upper treeline). In Wyoming, they are reported occupying spruce-fir forest, lodgepole pine-Douglas-fir forest, and ponderosa pine forest (Clark and Stromberg 1987). In Colorado, they have been reported in ponderosa pine-Douglas-fir forest (Bergstrom 1988). In more southern regions of the global range, they are most often associated with ponderosa pine habitats, but also are found in drier pinyon pine-juniper woodlands; in California and Nevada they also are found in bristlecone pine woodlands (Bergstrom 1999). They often are found near logs and brush in open areas and at forest edges, sometimes in forest with a closed canopy but an open understory. They excavate burrows beneath rocks and shrubs, but also are arboreal to some degree, spending a fair amount of time in trees and sometimes sleeping and nesting in tree cavities.

The term tabloid journalism, along with the use of large pictures, tends to emphasize topics such as sensational crime stories, astrology, celebrity gossip and television. However, some reputable newspapers, such as The Times, are in tabloid format, and this size is used in the United Kingdom by nearly all local newspapers. There, its page dimensions are roughly 430 \u00d7. In the United States, it is commonly the format employed by alternative newspapers. Some small-format papers which claim a higher standard of journalism refer to themselves as compact newspapers instead. [PAR] Larger newspapers, traditionally associated with higher-quality journalism, are often called broadsheets, and this designation often remains in common usage even if the newspaper moves to printing on smaller pages, as many have in recent years.  Thus the terms tabloid and broadsheet are, in non-technical usage, today more descriptive of a newspaper's market position than its physical size. [PAR] The Berliner format used by many prominent European newspapers is sized between the tabloid and the broadsheet. In a newspaper context, the term Berliner is generally used only to describe size, not to refer to other qualities of the publication. [PAR] History [PAR] The word \"tabloid\" comes from the name given by the London-based pharmaceutical company Burroughs Wellcome & Co. to the compressed tablets they marketed as \"Tabloid\" pills in the late 1880s.   The connotation of tabloid was soon applied to other small compressed items. A 1902 item in London's Westminister Gazette noted, \"The proprietor intends to give in tabloid form all the news printed by other journals.\"  Thus \"tabloid journalism\" in 1901 originally meant a paper that condensed stories into a simplified, easily absorbed format. The term preceded the 1918 reference to smaller sheet newspapers that contained the condensed stories.  [PAR] Dimensions [PAR] A tabloid is defined as \"roughly 17 by\" and commonly \"half the size of a broadsheet\". [PAR] Types [PAR] Tabloid newspapers, especially in the United Kingdom, boast a very high degree of variation as far as target market, political alignment, editorial style, and circulation are concerned.  Thus, various terms have been coined to describe the subtypes of this versatile paper format.  There are, broadly, two main types of tabloid newspaper: red top and compact.  The distinction is largely of editorial style; both red top and compact tabloids span the width of the political spectrum from socialism to capitalist conservatism.  Red top tabloids are so named due to their tendency, in British and Commonwealth usage, to have their mastheads printed in red ink; the term compact was coined to avoid the connotation of the word tabloid, which implies a red top tabloid, and has lent its name to tabloid journalism, which is journalism after the fashion of red top reporters. [PAR] Red top tabloids [PAR] The red top tabloid is, for many, the prototypical example of the format; the ubiquity of this editorial style among newspapers of the tabloid format has made it persist in the minds of the public.  Red top tabloids, named after their distinguishing red mastheads, employ a form of writing known as tabloid journalism; this style emphasizes features such as sensational crime stories, astrology, gossip columns about the personal lives of celebrities and sports stars, and junk food news.  Celebrity gossip columns which appear in red top tabloids and focus on their sexual practices, misuse of narcotics, and the private aspects of their lives often border on, and sometimes cross the line of, defamation. [PAR] Red tops tend to be written with a simplistic, straightforward vocabulary and grammar; their layout, more often than not, gives greater prominence to the picture than to the word.  The writing style of red top tabloids is, ofttimes, accused of sensationalism; in other words, red tops have been accused of deliberately igniting controversy and selectively reporting on attention-grabbing stories, or those with shock value.

Gale [PAR] Last Modified Date: 07 January 2017 [PAR] Copyright Protected: [PAR] Top 10 facts about the world [PAR] A fishing gaff is a large metal hook that is attached to a handle or pole, and is used to hook a fish. A fisherman will reel in a fish to a boat, dock, or pier with a fishing rod, reel, and line. After bringing the fish close enough to reach, the fish will be hooked with the gaff to bring it out of the water. Because the fishing line may not be strong enough to land the fish, the gaff can be an effective tool to ensure the line does not break. [PAR] The length of a gaffing pole or handle varies. Fishing from a canoe, kayak, or small boat generally will require a hand gaff \u2014 typically shorter than 4 feet (about 1.2 m) long. Lip gaffs are a type of hand gaff that is used to grasp the mouth of a fish with minimal damage. These gaffs have become more common as part of catch-and-release fishing. Some lip gaffs come with scales so a fish can be weighed before it is returned to the water. [PAR] Someone fishing from a large boat or high pier will need a gaffing handle that is long enough to reach into the water to set the hook into the fish\u2019s body or jaw. Longer gaffs are known as fixed gaffs or stick gaffs. They can be rigid or extendible, which means their handles can be extended to various lengths for use in a variety of situations. [PAR] Generally, fixed gaff handles range up to 12 feet (about 3.7 m) long. The handles can be made of various materials, such as wood, fiberglass , or aluminum. Hooks usually are made of hard metals, such as iron or stainless steel, and vary in size, depending on the type of fish. Hooks are usually either barbed or straight at their tips, and are either C-shaped or J-shaped. [PAR] A specialized item called a flying gaff is used for large fish, such as marlin or tuna. Flying gaffs usually have a long rope between the hook base and the handle. Once a fish is stuck, a sharp tug releases the hook part. Usually, the rope is secured to a cleat or post on the boat, and the fisherman or crew can pull the fish in with the rope. [PAR] Using a gaff hook can seriously injure or kill a fish, so the hooks are generally used only if the fisherman intends to keep the fish. People who are engaged in catch-and-release fishing \u2014 where the fish is returned to the water with as little injury as possible \u2014 often use landing nets or merely cut the line as close as possible to the hook after the fish is near the boat or the shore, but still in the water. Most hooks are designed to dissolve in water relatively quickly, so unless the fish deeply swallows the hook, it generally causes little or no harm.

[PAR] Derek Jacobi, John Hurt and George Baker in I, Claudius\u00a0Photo: BBC [PAR] By Ben Lawrence [PAR] 7:00AM BST 04 Jun 2013 [PAR] Tonight, after 12 weeks of poisoning, incest, mass murder and cannibalism, BBC Four\u2019s repeat run of I, Claudius comes to an end. Herbert Wise\u2019s 1976 production based on Robert Graves \u2019s classic novels, while undeniably dated for a modern audience, remains a powerful, compelling piece of drama, crowned by an extraordinary performance from Sir Derek Jacobi , both commanding and vulnerable, in the title role. [PAR] It has been announced that US TV network HBO has commissioned a new adaptation of I, Claudius. A remake doesn\u2019t feel like sacrilege, and HBO are a quality broadcaster, yet it\u2019s a considerable undertaking and other attempts to take on Graves\u2019s work have proved abortive. Orson Welles abandoned a proposed film at a very early stage, while in 1937 Alexander Korda planned a version of the first book with Charles Laughton in the title role. Production was halted when Korda\u2019s then wife Merle Oberon (who had been cast as Claudius\u2019s wife Valeria Messalina) was injured in a car accident. [PAR] So what do HBO need to do to get it right? Here are a few suggestions. [PAR] Keep Robert Graves\u2019s prose intact [PAR] Though Graves always dismissed the novel as hack work, the books are well crafted and say a lot about the nature of freedom and the burden of history. The 1976 version did not stint on the prose and Claudius\u2019s monologues, which unfurl as he writes his diary, crackled on-screen thanks to the richness of Graves\u2019s language. [PAR] Related Articles [PAR] 20 May 2013 [PAR] Don\u2019t be afraid of long scenes [PAR] TV drama in the Seventies was more static than it is today and the scenes were therefore longer. This is an advantage as psychological depth is allowed, gradually, to build. A scene worth mentioning from the original is the devastating 10-minute confession from Lollia (played by Isabel Dean) that she cannot live with the memory of being abused by Tiberius. Her subsequent suicide is made all the more shocking by the eloquence of her speech. [PAR] Cast Ben Whishaw as Caligula [PAR] John Hurt\u2019s performance as the perverse, cruel emperor in the 1976 version was memorably loopy, and Whishaw shares with Hurt a mercurial quality. Look to Whishaw as Richard II for that unhinged intensity that is necessary for Caligula. [PAR] Use sex and violence sparingly [PAR] I, Claudius is set in ancient Rome. Sex and violence abound. But the new production should be wary of overloading the drama and risk desensitising its audience (see Spartacus). In the original, the horrific scene in which Caligula eats the foetus of his unborn child was effective in its use of suggestion. The viewer is drawn into the crazed world of Caligula as he spurs himself on to commit the terrible act, but then the camera pulls away, leaving you to imagine the horror. [PAR] Don\u2019t blow the budget on making Imperial Rome look authentic [PAR] Although I, Claudius has the potential to be epic in scale (marauding armies, massacres), the 1976 version had, by necessity, to keep the action off stage. What we were left with was a chamber piece which focused on the emotional and political landscape. [PAR] Embrace the theatricality [PAR] There is no denying that some of the acting in the original is a little broad. Those were the days when most actors spoke in RP. \u201cRemember my prophetic chickens!\u201d boomed the much-missed Margaret Tyzack with utter conviction. There is something very OTT about Imperial Rome, and using thespians who rise above the madness with well-articulated gusto is a necessity.

They are used both when the bird is young, and when the bird has been taken out of the aviary for a moult or other reasons. [PAR] The creance itself is thin, designed to be of as little inconvenience to the bird as possible. It's threaded through the swivel and tied with a falconer's knot. The creance typically extends to around 25 metres (82\u00a0feet), at which point the bird should be ready to fly free (without the use of the creance).[DOC] [TLE] Beginners Falconry Gear Guide - FalconStuff.comBeginners Falconry Gear Guide - FalconStuff.com [PAR] Browse the Store [PAR] Falconry Equipment Buyers Guide [PAR] Falconry is the art and sport of hunting with raptors. It has been practiced in many forms for thousands of years by many cultures, and it is also the oldest field sport known to mankind.  Falconry takes a lot of dedication, patience, and time spent with your bird almost everyday. It also requires special equipment and other necessary items to ensure a safe and effective training for your bird. [PAR] Falconry Equipment [PAR] Mews [PAR] A falconry bird is usually housed in a mews. This is, typically, an 8 by 8 feet-sized area, with perches, a bath, and other necessities for the bird. Mews can be a simple single chamber, and it can also have an equipment room attached, as well as a weathering yard where the bird is placed to sun and spend its days. [PAR] Hood [PAR] Probably the most important piece of equipment among others, a hood is used in acclimatizing the birds to humans and the human world. It also helps keep the raptor in a calm state, both in the early part of its training and throughout its falconry career. Hoods are made of several different patterns, each designed for particular species [PAR] Arab or Bahraini [PAR] This style is marked by a circular pattern to make the hood fit the contours of the eyes and head. The braces are woven in and out of leather pleats, making an accordion of the back's base which tends not to catch the bird's crest feathers. [PAR] Dutch [PAR] Traditionally made from three pieces of leather, but is recently being made from a single piece as well. It has an inverted V opening in the back where the braces close. Although the Dutch hood style was used exclusively on falcons, a good, well-made Dutch hood will properly fit a hawk, falcon, or accipiter of the right size. [PAR] Indian, Pakistan, or Amritsari [PAR] This hood style is from Pakistan and is sometimes also known as the Indian hood outside the Indian subcontinent. Generally thought to best fit Accipiters, eagles, and Ferruginous hawks, many falconers dislike this hood style and prefer the Dutch hood for all their various species instead. [PAR] British \"Game Hawkers\" Hood [PAR] - The plume for this style of hood would be made from the first type of game caught with the falcon. When falcons are carried on the cage, one could quickly see the required falcon by the color of the eye panels and the type of feathers in its plume. Green felt eye panels would be used for a Crow hawk. [PAR] Kazakh [PAR] This hood originated in Mongolia and is used by the Kazakh falconers, most typically on Golden Eagles. The tab at the top or back of this hood serves the same function as the more familiar top knot. [PAR] Bells [PAR] Bells are great help in locating a falcon or hawk out of sight. This is usually attached on its legs via small leather strips called bewits. [PAR] Bewit [PAR] Bewits are small strips of leather which attach the bells or other hardware to the bird's leg. If a different material is used as a bewit, it should not be attached directly to the leg, but rather to the anklet. [PAR] Anklets [PAR] An anklet is a leather strap which goes around the bird's leg. The jesses are attached to this. It is sometimes referred to as a bracelet.

[PAR] The ritual observance of this holiday centers around a special home service called the seder (meaning \"order\") and a festive meal; the prohibition of chametz (leaven); and the eating of matzah (an unleavened bread). On the eve of the fifteenth day of Nisan in the Hebrew calendar, we read from a book called the hagaddah, meaning \"telling,\" which contains the order of prayers, rituals, readings and songs for the Pesach seder. The Pesach seder is the only ritual meal in the Jewish calendar year for which such an order is prescribed, hence its name. [PAR] The seder has a number of scriptural bases. Exodus 12:3-11 describes the meal of lamb, unleavened bread, and bitter herbs which the Israelites ate just prior to the Exodus. In addition, three separate passages in Exodus (12:26-7, 13:8, 13:14) and one in Deuteronomy (6:20-21) enunciate the duty of the parents to tell the story of the Exodus to their children. The seder plate contains various symbolic foods referred to in the seder itself. [PAR] The story of Joseph gives us the background for how our people ended up in Egypt. It begins with our patriarch Jacob and his 12 sons. One of the sons, Joseph, was the most favored by his father, which caused tension between Joseph and his brothers, who sold him into slavery. The brothers told Jacob that a wild animal had killed Joseph. In truth, Joseph ended up in Egypt where he had many adventures, one of which landed him in jail.Through his ability to interpret dreams, Joseph became an advisor to Pharaoh, managing the country's food supply so that the people would be fed during the predicted seven years of famine.The famine extended into the land of Canaan where Jacob and his family lived. Joseph's brothers went down to Egypt in search of food and came before Joseph, but they did not recognize him. Eventually Joseph identified himself to his brothers and invited them and the entire household of Jacob to come down to Egypt so they would survive the famine. [PAR] Many generations later, a new Pharaoh arose \"who knew not Joseph.\" This Pharaoh enslaved the Hebrews and ordered all of their newborn baby boys killed.A newborn, Moses, was saved by the ingenuity of his mother and sister when he was set adrift in a basket in the Nile. As his sister Miriam watched, she saw that Pharaoh's daughter discovered the baby and decided to raise the Hebrew child as her own. Miriam offered to arrange for a Hebrew nurse (Moses' mother) to feed and care for the child. [PAR] Moses grew up, and one day he witnessed an Egyptian overseer beating a Hebrew slave. So angered by this sight, Moses killed the overseer. Subsequently, he saw two Hebrew slaves arguing and tried to stop them.They turned to him, and one said,\"Will you kill me as you killed the Egyptian overseer?\" Realizing that there was a witness to the murder and becoming concerned for his life,Moses escaped into the desert. On that journey, God appeared to Moses in a burning bush that was not consumed, and told him to go back to Egypt and deliver the Hebrews from slavery. [PAR] With his brother Aaron, Moses went before Pharaoh to demand that the Hebrews be set free. Pharaoh continually refused, and the plagues descended upon Egypt. With the 10th plague, the killing of the firstborn, Pharaoh relented and allowed the Hebrews to leave. In their haste, the Israelites took unleavened dough that baked on their backs into matzah. [PAR] The Passover Seder reminds us of our ancestor's journey down into Egypt, our enslavement there and our eventual flight to freedom. In Jewish tradition, because of the centrality of this story, we are not simply to remember these events\n\n\n### Answer:\npassover </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Moreover expecially in Northen Italy, were they were stronger, communists/republicans de facto forbade monarchist electoral campaign by violence (they even forced people, in some cases, to vote for Republic); it's a fact that Monarchy got a huge amount of votes in Southern and Central Italy, while Republic got almost all of its votes in Northen Italy. [PAR] At first they said Morchy had won, and it was even referred to Pope Pius XII in Vatican Ciity. But communists/repubblicans threatened other political forces by promising civil war if Republic would had lost the referendum; Giuseppe Romita, a socialist leader said \"Or Republic, or caos\". At night De Gasperi and other political leaders went to King Humbert II annuncing Monarchy had lost the referendum. King Humbert asked a recount but Supreme Court, thretened and scared by communists/republicans, declared itself unable either to accept or reject King's request; however Supreme Cout had still to officially proclame electoral results, as provided for law. Not waiting for Supreme Court's declaration, Government - being too scared of a possible recounting wich could have been favourable to Monarchy - declared Monarchy's fall and Republic's birth; according to law, this action's considered as a coup d'\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdtat (let\n\n\n### Answer:\nitaly </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

For centuries Honiton            has been renowned for lace, pottery and glove making, and although these            time honoured crafts are no longer carried out to their former extent,            Honiton has numerous specialist shops dedicated to both lace and pottery. [PAR] In more recent years,          the town has also become the main centre in the West Country for antiques          and antiquarian books. Honiton is a magnet for antique dealers and bargain          hunters from all over the world, who come to browse in the 30 or so establishments,          or to visit one of the regular auctions. [PAR] Strategically situated            in South-East Devon, Honiton, is one of the traditional gateways into            the county of Devonshire, making it an excellent base for people wishing            to visit or to tour East Devon. [PAR] Honiton is within            easy reach of both of the West Country's National Parks - Dartmoor and            Exmoor, as well as being close to Exeter - the ancient capital of the            South West. Vast tracts of the area surrounding Honiton are designated            as areas of outstanding natural beauty and the town's location, near            to the River Otter, provides the visitor with an abundance of country            walks and footpaths to explore. [PAR] During the 18th            century, fires destroyed many of Honiton's older buildings. The re-building            program created much of what we see today - a unique town, which is            still largely 18th century in character. Honiton is both an attractive            and prosperous town with an excellent shopping centre, holding twice-weekly            street markets. It is twinned with Gronau-Leine in Germany and Mezidon-Canon            in France, with regular exchange visits taking place between local schools            and organisations. [PAR] Honiton                  Lace [PAR] Lace making                  was for hundreds of years, the main industry of the town. Honiton                  had a large population of lace-makers - women who would sit outside                  their houses using the bright sunlight to weave highly complicated                  and delicate pieces. [PAR] Lace making                  was an extremely labour intensive craft, with even the smallest                  piece requiring a high degree of skill and precision to make. Eventually,                  machine made lace products became a cheaper alternative - causing                  Honiton's lace making industry to go into a decline. [PAR] In 1841,                  lace makers from the Honiton area were commisioned to supply lace                  for Queen Victoria's wedding dress. The Queen was so impressed                  by the quality of the work, so she commisioned a second piece                  as a christening robe of her eldest son, later to be King Edward                  VII. This delicately woven lace gown is still in use today. [PAR] Historically, Honiton            was one of the centres for the West Country's medieval cloth trade,            but over time, the town became famous as a centre for lace - due to            the locally manufactured lace products being shipped from the town.            The town's Allhallow's Museum, holds the World's principal collection            of Honiton Lace and there are many shops in the town, specialising in            lace and pottery, as well as antiques for which Honiton is now renowned. [PAR] The gentle, fertile            agricultural land around Honiton has been inhabited since Neolithic            times. The massive hillfort of Hembury Castle nearby, originated            in the Neolithic period and was re-occupied and re-fortified during            the Iron Age. The            name of the town is Anglo Saxon and probably derives from the farm or            settlement ('ton') of somebody called 'Huna'. [PAR] Daniel Defoe visited            the town, in the 1720's, saying of the town that it was 'large and            beautiful...very populous and well built'.

Adolf Hitler moved against the SA and its leader, Ernst R\u00f6hm, because he saw the independence of the SA and the penchant of its members for street violence as a direct threat to his power. Hitler also wanted to conciliate leaders of the Reichswehr, the official German military. They both feared and despised the SA and in particular feared R\u00f6hm's ambition to absorb the Reichswehr into the SA under his own leadership. Finally, Hitler used the purge to attack or eliminate critics of his regime, especially those loyal to Vice-Chancellor Franz von Papen, and to settle scores with old enemies. [PAR] At least 85 people died during the purge, although the final death toll may have been in the hundreds, and more than a thousand perceived opponents were arrested. Most of the killings were carried out by the Schutzstaffel (SS) and the Gestapo (Geheime Staatspolizei), the regime's secret police. The purge strengthened and consolidated the support of the Reichswehr for Hitler. It also provided a legal grounding for the Nazi regime, as the German courts and cabinet quickly swept aside centuries of legal prohibition against extra-judicial killings to demonstrate their loyalty to the regime. [PAR] Before its execution, its planners sometimes referred to it as \"Hummingbird\" (German: Kolibri), as that was the codeword used to set the execution squads in motion on the day of the purge. The codename for the operation appears to have been chosen arbitrarily. The phrase \"Night of the Long Knives\" in the German language predates the massacre itself, and it also refers generally to acts of vengeance. To this day, Germans still use the term \"R\u00f6hm-Putsch\" (\"R\u00f6hm coup d\u2019\u00e9tat\") to describe the event, as that was the term the Nazi regime used at the time, despite its overall false implication that the murders were necessary to forestall a coup. To emphasize this, German authors often use quotation marks or write about the so-called R\u00f6hm-Putsch.[DOC] [TLE] Night of the Long Knives - Jun 30, 1934 - HISTORY.comNight of the Long Knives - Jun 30, 1934 - HISTORY.com [PAR] Night of the Long Knives [PAR] Share this: [PAR] Night of the Long Knives [PAR] Author [PAR] Night of the Long Knives [PAR] URL [PAR] Publisher [PAR] A+E Networks [PAR] In Germany, Nazi leader Adolf Hitler orders a bloody purge of his own political party, assassinating hundreds of Nazis whom he believed had the potential to become political enemies in the future. The leadership of the Nazi Storm Troopers (SA), whose four million members had helped bring Hitler to power in the early 1930s, was especially targeted. Hitler feared that some of his followers had taken his early \u201cNational Socialism\u201d propaganda too seriously and thus might compromise his plan to suppress workers\u2019 rights in exchange for German industry making the country war-ready. [PAR] In the early 1920s, the ranks of Hitler\u2019s Nazi Party swelled with resentful Germans who sympathized with the party\u2019s bitter hatred of Germany\u2019s democratic government, leftist politics, and Jews. In November 1923, after the German government resumed the payment of war reparations to Britain and France, the Nazis launched the \u201cBeer Hall Putsch\u201d\u2013their first attempt at seizing the German government by force.  Hitler hoped that his nationalist revolution in Bavaria would spread to the dissatisfied German army, which in turn would bring down the government in Berlin. However, the uprising was immediately suppressed, and Hitler was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison for high treason.

In focusing on the image of a woman crying, the artist was no longer painting                           the effects of the Spanish Civil War directly, but rather referring to a singular universal image of suffering. [PAR] Picasso's insistence that we imagine ourselves into the excoriated face of this woman, into her dark eyes, was part of his response to seeing newspaper photographs of the Luftwaffe's bombing of Guernica on behalf of Franco in the                           Spanish civil war on April 26, 1937. The Weeping Woman, 1937 came at the end of the series of paintings, prints and drawings that Picasso made in protest. It has very personal, Spanish sources. In May 1937 Picasso's mother                           wrote to him from Barcelona that smoke from the burning city during the fighting made her eyes water. The Mater Dolorosa, the weeping Virgin, is a traditional image in Spanish art, often represented in lurid baroque sculptures with                           glass tears, like the very solid one that flows towards this woman's right ear. Picasso's father, an artist, made one for the family home.

Licensed by Viscopy, Sydney 2006 [PAR] A Journey Through the Exhibition [PAR] Weeping Woman Series [PAR] Picasso returned to the theme of the Weeping Woman, first seen in Guernica clutching the body of her dead child, in a series of drawings, etchings and paintings made in September and October of 1937. These unsettling, emotive works are often read simplistically as mere descriptions of Dora's fiery temperament and the volatile nature of her relationship with Picasso. They are, however, far more complex and explore the fascinating dynamic between the works, the artist and the model. [PAR] While the Weeping Women series embodies the essence of Picasso's beloved muse, Dora, it can also be read as a self\u2013portrait revealing the inner torment of a man haunted by horrific images of the massacres taking place in the Spanish Civil War. In the artistic partnership between Dora and Picasso we again see the special empathy between the lovers, where Dora is not simply a model but an impassioned political accomplice (outraged by Fascism) deeply committed to conveying a powerful, universal message condemning war. Dora willingly submits her features to be brutally distorted and deconstructed by Picasso who contorts her beauty into a harsh ugliness to arouse raw human emotions of anguish, compassion and despair. [PAR] The harrowing images that summarise the intense suffering of victims of war through the depiction of a desperate weeping woman have also been interpreted as a modern translation of the ancient Christian motif of the grief\u2013stricken Virgin Mary mourning her dead son, Jesus Christ.

His next post was first secretary of the council of ministers to which he was appointed in September 1881.[2] However, in October 1881 he again began to work in the justice ministry. Upon the request of Mahmoud Sami al-Barudi, Ghali was awarded the rank of Pasha, being the first Coptic recipient of such an honour in Egypt.[2] In 1886, he was appointed head of a commission for the selection of Sharia court judges, which was an unusual appointment due to his religious background, leading to protests by Muslims.[2] [PAR] Ghali's first ministerial portfolio was the minister of finance in 1893.[3] Then he was made foreign minister in 1894.[3] He was appointed prime minister on 8 November 1908, replacing Mustafa Fahmi Pasha.[4] He also retained the post of foreign minister during his premiership.[3] Ghali remained in office until 21 February 1910 and was replaced by Muhammad Said Pasha.[4] [PAR] Death[edit] Ghali was accused of favouring the British in the Denshawai incident. On 20 February 1910, Ghali was shot by Ibrahim Nassif al-Wardani, a twenty-three year old pharmacology graduate,[5] who had just returned from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.[6] Ghali was leaving the ministry of foreign affairs when Wardani attacked him.[7] Ghali died on 21 February.[7] [PAR] The assassin who confessed to the killing of Ghali was educated in Lausanne, Paris and London and a member of Mustafa Kamil Pasha's Watani Party.[5] Wardani's father was a governor and his uncle was a pasha.[5] Wardani was executed on 28 June 1910.[7] [PAR]\n\n\n### Answer:\nboutros ghali </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Over time, the name was Anglicized to Alcatraz. While the exact meaning is still                                     debated, Alcatraz is usually defined as meaning \"pelican\" or \"strange bird.\" [PAR] In 1850, a presidential order set aside the island for possible use as a United States military reservation. The                                     California Gold Rush, the resulting boom in the growth of San Francisco, and the need to protect San Francisco Bay                                     led the U.S. Army to build a Citadel, or fortress, at the top of the island in the early 1850s. The Army also made                                     plans to install more than 100 cannons on the island, making Alcatraz the most heavily fortified military site on                                     the West Coast. Together with Fort Point and Lime Point, Alcatraz formed a \"triangle of defense\" designed to protect                                     the entrance to the bay. The island was also the site of the first operational lighthouse on the West Coast of the                                     United States. [PAR] By the late 1850s, the first military prisoners were being housed on the island. While the defensive necessity of                                     Alcatraz diminished over time (the island never fired its guns in battle), its role as a prison would continue for                                     more than 100 years. In 1909, the Army tore down the Citadel, leaving its basement level to serve as the foundation                                     for a new military prison. From 1909 through 1911, the military prisoners on Alcatraz built the new prison, which was                                     designated the Pacific Branch, U.S. Disciplinary Barracks for the U.S. Army. It was this prison building that later                                     became famous as \"The Rock.\" [PAR] The U.S. Army used the island for more than 80 years--from 1850 until 1933, when the island was transferred to                                     the U.S. Department of Justice for use by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The Federal Government had decided to                                     open a maximum-security, minimum-privilege penitentiary to deal with the most incorrigible inmates in Federal                                     prisons, and to show the law-abiding public that the Federal Government was serious about stopping the rampant                                     crime of the 1920s and 1930s.

[PAR] The average population                                 was only about 260-275 (the prison never once reached its capacity of 336 - at any given time, Alcatraz held less                                 than 1 percent of the total Federal prison population). Many prisoners actually considered the living conditions                                 (for instance, always one man to a cell) at Alcatraz to be better than other Federal prisons, and several inmates                                 actually requested a transfer to Alcatraz.  But while USP Alcatraz was not the \"America's Devil's Island\" that                                  books and movies often portrayed, it was designed to be a prison system's prison. [PAR] If a man did not behave at another institution, he could be sent to Alcatraz, where                                 the highly structured, monotonous daily routine was designed to teach an inmate to follow rules and regulations.                                 At Alcatraz, a prisoner had four rights: food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. Everything else was a privilege                                 that had to be earned. Some privileges a prisoner could earn included: working, corresponding with and having visits                                 from family members, access to the prison library, and recreational activities such as painting and music.

[PAR] (Edward Fraser and John Gibbons, Soldier and Sailor Words and Phrases, 1925) [PAR] The NATO phonetic alphabet is a spelling alphabet --a standard set of 26 words for letter names--used by airline pilots, police, the military, and other officials when communicating over radio or telephone. The purpose of the phonetic alphabet is to ensure that letters are clearly understood even when speech is distorted. [PAR] More formally known as the\u00a0International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet\u00a0(also called the ICAO phonetic or spelling alphabet),\u00a0the NATO phonetic alphabet was developed in the 1950s as part of the International Code of Signals (INTERCO), which originally included visual and sound signals.

In the U.S., the International Code of Signals was adopted in 1897 and updated in 1927, but it wasn't until 1938 that all the letters in the alphabet were assigned a word. [PAR] Back in the days of World War II, the phonetic alphabet began with the letters \"Able, Baker, Charlie,\"\u00a0K\u00a0was \"King,\" and\u00a0S\u00a0was \"Sugar.\" After the war, when the NATO alliance was formed, the phonetic alphabet was changed to make it easier for the people who speak the different languages found in the alliance. That version has remained the same, and today the phonetic alphabet begins with \"Alfa, Bravo, Charlie,\"\u00a0K\u00a0is now \"Kilo,\" and\u00a0S\u00a0is \"Sierra.\" [PAR] (The Bluejackets' Manual. Naval Institute Press, 2002) [PAR] Today the NATO Phonetic Alphabet is widely used throughout North America and Europe. [PAR] Note that the NATO phonetic alphabet is not\u00a0 phonetic in the sense that linguists use the term.

Although often called \"phonetic alphabets\", spelling alphabets are not associated with phonetic transcription systems such as the International Phonetic Alphabet. Instead, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) alphabet assigned codewords acrophonically to the letters of the English alphabet, so that critical combinations of letters and numbers can be pronounced and understood by those who exchange voice messages by radio or telephone regardless of language barriers or the quality of the communication channel.

The business forum was designed for the Prime Minister to meet with leaders from US leading groups.\u00a0 The selection of Houston is in part in recognition that Vietnam will in two months time have a fully functioning Consulate General in Houson, the fourth Vietnamese location in the U.S. with the Embassy in Washington, DC, Consulates General in San Francisco and now Houston and the Vietnamese U.N. delegation in New York.

Credit: Hallam Football Club [PAR] By Daniel Rose [PAR] Milan\u2019s towering San Siro, Liverpool\u2019s magical Anfield, Madrid\u2019s majestic Bernabeau, are all among the most historic of football stadia. But none of them can boast a history as long as that of Sandygate Road, in the Sheffield suburb of Crosspool. This unlikely venue is the oldest football stadium in the world. [PAR] First built in 1804 for cricket, in 1860 it became the home of Hallam Football Club, and has been ever since. To find out more about this football heritage site, I made my way to Sandygate Road to talk to the co-chairman of Hallam F.C, Chris Taylor. I was interested to find out how well known Sandygate is among football fans around the world. As the world\u2019s oldest football stadium, is it a place of football pilgrimage? [PAR] \u201cYes! In fact, we have visits from a group of stadium enthusiasts known as \u201cGround hoppers\u201d who love to visit football grounds around the country. We have also had visitors from Ireland and Germany, and some from as far away as the USA!\u201d [PAR] I wondered if these enthusiasts included any stars of the beautiful game. [PAR] \u201cYes we have regular visits from football stars. Chris Waddle runs our Sunday League team and a number of local ex-footballers have played at the stadium. Sandygate was also used as the location for the film \u201cWhen Saturday Comes\u201d with Sean Bean.\u201d [PAR] Hallam chairman, Chris Taylor. Credit: Hallam Football Club [PAR] With such a famous home, it sounds as if Hallam F.C, should have no difficulty in marketing itself, and attracting new fans. But Chris pointed out that this is not the case: [PAR] \u201cIt is still very difficult to generate interest in the club within Sheffield 10 itself, however we do get media coverage linked to the stadium and our part in the history of the game, but probably not as much as you would expect.\u201d [PAR] Perhaps the ground\u2019s claim to fame helps to bring new players to the club? Again, not as much as you would expect, as Taylor explains: [PAR] \u201cI think it may help a little but most players go where the money is and that\u2019s not Sandygate!\u201d [PAR] On the subject of finance, I wondered whether the club were able to find the resources to maintain this old stadium. Has Sandygate Road needed a lick of paint down the years and has it needed any restoration? Chris Taylor explained to me how this has been achieved: [PAR] \u201cWell it has! A few years ago a supporter called Roger Bell left his estate to the club with a view to investing it in the facilities and that is exactly what we did. We replaced all the walls and fencing around the periphery, a new boundary wall and barriers around the pitch, new goal posts, refurbished the changing rooms, added a new Medical room and a kitchen from where to serve refreshments. Most importantly, we built the 1860 suite on the site of the old clubhouse, and it must be one of the nicest facilities at our level of the game.\u201d [PAR] So, does the chairman believe that Sandygate Road will always be here? [PAR] \u201cYes if our hard working team of volunteers have anything to do with it, It is part of the Sheffield heritage and we must protect it for generations to come.\u201d [PAR] Hallam F.C. has another claim to fame, in that they are also the second oldest football club in the world. The oldest club are their neighbours Sheffield F.C., and matches between the two are the oldest derby games! Surely this must also help to put Hallam F.C. on the map? [PAR] \u201cIt raises local awareness but Sheffield have more resource than ourselves and play at a higher level thus earning the right to the bigger fan base.\u201d [PAR] But the two clubs formation must have made a huge contribution to football in Sheffield and\n\n\n### Answer:\nsheffield </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Many versions conclude the game when the first person achieves a specified pattern from the drawn numbers. The winner is usually required to call out the word \"Bingo!\", which alerts the other players and caller of a possible win.  All wins are checked to make sure the person has not made a mistake before the win is officially confirmed at which time the prize is secured and a new game is begun. In this version of bingo, players compete against one another for the prize or jackpot. [PAR] Alternative methods of play try to increase participation by creating excitement.  Since its invention in 1929, modern bingo has evolved into multiple variations, with each jurisdiction's gambling laws regulating how the game is played.  There are also nearly unlimited patterns that may be specified for play.  Some games require only one number to be matched, while cover-all games award the jackpot for covering an entire card. There are even games that award prizes to players for matching no numbers or achieving no pattern. See \"Variations\" for more details. [PAR] Bingo cards [PAR] The most common Bingo cards are flat pieces of cardboard or disposable paper which contain 25 squares arranged in five vertical columns and five side to side rows. Each space in the grid contains a number. [PAR] A typical Bingo game utilizes the numbers 1 through 75.  The five columns of the card are labeled 'B', 'I', 'N', 'G', and 'O' from left to right.  The center space is usually marked \"Free\" or \"Free Space\", and is considered automatically filled.  The range of printed numbers that can appear on the card is normally restricted by column, with the 'B' column only containing numbers between 1 and 15 inclusive, the 'I' column containing only 16 through 30, 'N' containing 31 through 45, 'G' containing 46 through 60, and 'O' containing 61 through 75. [PAR] The number of all possible Bingo cards with these standard features is P(15,5) \u00d7 P(15,5) \u00d7 P(15,5) \u00d7 P(15,5) \u00d7 P(15,4) = 552,446,474,061,128,648,601,600,000 or approximately 5.52\u00d71026. [PAR] In U-Pick 'Em bingo and other variants of bingo, players are issued three 25 number cards which contain all 75 numbers that may be drawn.  Players then mark which numbers they wish to play and then daub those numbers according to the numbers drawn. In addition, double-action cards have two numbers in each square. [PAR] A player wins by completing a row, column, or diagonal. The most chips one can place on a Bingo board without having a Bingo is 19, not counting the free space. In order for this to happen, only one empty cell can reside in each row and each column, and at least one empty cell must be in each diagonal, for instance: [PAR] B I N G O [PAR] \u25cf \u25cf \u00a0 \u25cf \u25cf [PAR] \u25cf \u00a0 \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf [PAR] \u25cf \u25cf \u25a1 \u25cf \u00a0 [PAR] \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u00a0 \u25cf [PAR] \u00a0 \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf [PAR] In addition to a straight line, other patterns may be considered a valid bingo in special games. For example, in the illustration above, the 2x2 square of marked squares in the upper-right-hand corner would be considered a \"postage stamp\". Another common special game requires players to cover the four corners. There are several other patterns, such as a Roving 'L', which requires players to cover all B's and top or bottom row or all O's and top or bottom row. Another common pattern is a blackout, covering all 24 numbers and the free space.

Unlike the Summer Olympics, the Winter Olympics feature sports practiced on snow and ice. The first Winter Olympics, the 1924 Winter Olympics, was held in Chamonix, France. The original five sports (broken into nine disciplines) were bobsleigh, curling, ice hockey, Nordic skiing (consisting of the disciplines military patrol, cross-country skiing, Nordic combined, and ski jumping), and skating (consisting of the disciplines figure skating  and speed skating). The Games were held every four years from 1924 until 1936, after which they were interrupted by World War II. The Olympics resumed in 1948 and was again held every four years. Until 1992, the Winter and Summer Olympic Games were held in the same years, but in accordance with a 1986 decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to place the Summer and Winter Games on separate four-year cycles in alternating even-numbered years, the next Winter Olympics after 1992 was in 1994. [PAR] The Winter Games have evolved since its inception. Sports and disciplines have been added and some of them, such as Alpine skiing, luge, short track speed skating, freestyle skiing, skeleton, and snowboarding, have earned a permanent spot on the Olympic program. Others (such as curling and bobsleigh) have been discontinued and later reintroduced, or have been permanently discontinued (such as military patrol, though the modern Winter Olympic sport of biathlon is descended from it). Still others, such as speed skiing, bandy and skijoring, were demonstration sports but never incorporated as Olympic sports. The rise of television as a global medium for communication enhanced the profile of the Games. It created an income stream, via the sale of broadcast rights and advertising, which has become lucrative for the IOC. This allowed outside interests, such as television companies and corporate sponsors, to exert influence. The IOC has had to address several criticisms, internal scandals, the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Winter Olympians, as well as a political boycott of the Winter Olympics. Nations have used the Winter Games to showcase the claimed superiority of their political systems. [PAR] The Winter Olympics has been hosted on three continents by eleven different countries. The United States has hosted the Games four times (1932, 1960, 1980, 2002); France has been the host three times (1924, 1968, 1992);  Austria (1964, 1976), Canada (1988, 2010), Japan (1972, 1998), Italy (1956, 2006), Norway (1952, 1994), and Switzerland (1928, 1948) have hosted the Games twice. Germany (1936), Yugoslavia (1984), and Russia (2014) have hosted the Games once. The IOC has selected Pyeongchang, South Korea, to host the 2018 Winter Olympics and Beijing, China, to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. No country in the southern hemisphere has hosted or even been an applicant to host the Winter Olympics; the major challenge preventing one hosting the games is the dependence on winter weather, and the traditional February timing of the games falls in the middle of the southern hemisphere summer.

Sources state that she was the daughter of Nereus and Doris, which makes Amphitrite one of the fifty sea goddesses (or nymphs) who are known collectively as the Nereids. The Greek poet Hesiod lists the names of these sea nymphs in his Theogony: [PAR] \u201cTo Nereus and Doris of the lovely hair, [PAR] the daughter of Okeanos, the stream surrounding the earth, [PAR] a host of godly daughters was born in the barren sea: [PAR] Proto, Eukrante, Amphitrite, and Sao\u2026\u201d [PAR] (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 240-43) [PAR] According to the legend, the Olympian Poseidon (who was himself a god of the sea) saw Amphitrite one day and fell in love with the graceful and beautiful goddess. However, the sea nymph initially resisted Poseidon\u2019s advances. But Poseidon was not easily discouraged. He sent his sea creatures to find Amphitrite. A dolphin succeeded in locating the Nereid, and it was this creature - the dolphin - who persuaded her to consider Poseidon\u2019s proposal. Eventually, Amphitrite accepted Poseidon, and the two gods were married. [PAR] Amphitrite and Poseidon were together the parents of several children, including the sea god Triton. Here\u2019s Hesiod again: [PAR] \u201cFrom the union of rumbling Poseidon and Amphitrite [PAR] came the great Triton, whose might is far-flung, [PAR] an awesome god dwelling in a golden house that lies [PAR] at the sea\u2019s bottom, near his cherished mother and lordly father.\u201d [PAR] (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 930 ff. )[DOC] [TLE] Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea - Greek Gods and GoddessesAmphitrite Goddess of the Sea [PAR] [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site [PAR] Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea [PAR] In Greek mythology, Amphitrite goddess of the Sea was one of the fifty Nereids, that is a daughter of Nereus and Doris - that's what Hesiod writes in his Theogony (but Apollodorus says her parents were Oceanus and Thetys). Her Roman equivalent was Salacia, god Neptune's wife. [PAR] Her name means \"The third one who encircles (everything)\" (because the ancient Greeks thought the whole world was encircled by a river-god, Oceanus ). [PAR] She spent most of the time singing and dancing with her sisters. One day Poseidon, god of the sea , saw her near the island of Naxos and fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and made her his wife. [PAR] In another story, Amphitrite, being a shy girl, fled away and hid somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Poseidon wanted desperately to find her, so he sent all the marine creatures to look for her. Delphinus, a dolphin, managed to find her and convinced her to go back to Poseidon and marry him. That's what made Amphitrite goddess of the sea. (By the way, the dolphin who found her was turned into a constellation by the grateful Poseidon ). [PAR] Amphitrite goddess of the sea has no special attributions (but sometimes she can calm the waters), she is just the mistress of the sea (and sometimes she is considered the mother of the marine creatures, but they existed even before she became queen of the sea). Some even say that she is just a personification of the sea. [PAR] She also appeared briefly in the story of Theseus. King Minos asked the hero to prove that he really was Poseidon's son. A ring was thrown into the sea and Theseus had to bring it back. The sea creatures found the ring and gave it to the hero, while Amphitrite goddess of the sea received him in her underwater palace and gave him a golden crown, which he took to Ariadne as a wedding gift. (As you can see, Amphitrite was the ideal wife, as she was never jealous of her husband's love affairs.) [PAR] Amphitrite and Poseidon had a son, Triton (a fish-man or a he-mermaid) and a daughter, Rhode, and maybe another daughter, Benthesicyme.

[PAR] Related Topics [PAR] Betsy Ross [PAR] After the American Revolution began, the first unofficial national flag\u2014known as the Continental Colours (or, incorrectly, as the Grand Union Flag or the Cambridge Flag)\u2014was hoisted at Prospect Hill in Charlestown (now in Somerville, Mass.) on Jan. 1, 1776; it was raised, it appears, at the behest of Gen. George Washington , whose headquarters were nearby. The flag had 13 horizontal stripes (probably of red and white or of red, white, and blue) and, in the canton, the first version of the British Union Flag ( Union Jack ). It was used at forts and on naval vessels. Another popular early flag, that of the Sons of Liberty , had the 13 stripes only. The various 18th-century \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d flags had only local significance, but in the 20th century such designs were popularized by political protesters. [PAR] The first official national flag, formally approved by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777, was the Stars and Stripes. The blue canton was to contain 13 stars, but the layout of the stars was left undefined, and several patterns are known. The designer of the flag, Congressman Francis Hopkinson , may have had a ring of stars in mind to symbolize (in the words of the flag law) \u201ca new constellation.\u201d Today that pattern is popularly known as the \u201c Betsy Ross flag,\u201d although the claims of her descendants that she made the first Stars and Stripes and that she used the ring pattern are unsubstantiated. Rows of stars (4-5-4 or 3-2-3-2-3) were common, but other variations also existed. The new Stars and Stripes formed part of the military colours carried on Sept. 11, 1777, at the Battle of the Brandywine , perhaps its first such use. [PAR] Similar Topics [PAR] flag of the Confederate States of America [PAR] The Stars and Stripes changed on May 1, 1795, when two more stars and two more stripes were added to reflect the admission to the union of Vermont (1791) and Kentucky (1792).

In 1818, after five more states had been admitted, Congress enacted legislation pertaining to a new flag, requiring that henceforth the number of stripes should remain 13, the number of stars should always match the number of states, and any new star should be added on the July 4 following a state\u2019s admission. This has been the system ever since. In all, from 1777 to 1960 (after the admission of Hawaii in 1959) there were 27 versions of the flag\u201425 involving changes in the stars only. An executive order of Oct. 29, 1912, standardized the proportions and relative sizes of the elements of the flag; in 1934 the exact shades of colour were standardized. [PAR] There is no official assignment of meaning or symbolism to the colours of the flag. However, Charles Thomson , secretary of the Continental Congress, in describing the proposed Great Seal, suggested the following symbolism: \u201cWhite signifies purity and innocence, Red, hardiness & valour, and Blue\u2026signifies vigilence, perseverence [sic] & justice.\u201d As with many other national flags, the Stars and Stripes has long been a focus of patriotic sentiment .

[PAR] After silver was discovered nearby in 1877, Tombstone quickly grew into one of the richest mining towns in the Southwest. Wyatt Earp, a former Kansas police officer working as a bank security guard, and his brothers, Morgan and Virgil, the town marshal, represented \u201claw and order\u201d in Tombstone, though they also had reputations as being power-hungry and ruthless. The Clantons and McLaurys were cowboys who lived on a ranch outside of town and sidelined as cattle rustlers, thieves and murderers. In October 1881, the struggle between these two groups for control of Tombstone and Cochise County ended in a blaze of gunfire at the OK Corral. [PAR] On the morning of October 25, Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury came into Tombstone for supplies. Over the next 24 hours, the two men had several violent run-ins with the Earps and their friend Doc Holliday. Around 1:30 p.m. on October 26, Ike\u2019s brother Billy rode into town to join them, along with Frank McLaury and Billy Claiborne. The first person they met in the local saloon was Holliday, who was delighted to inform them that their brothers had both been pistol-whipped by the Earps. Frank and Billy immediately left the saloon, vowing revenge. [PAR] Around 3 p.m., the Earps and Holliday spotted the five members of the Clanton-McLaury gang in a vacant lot behind the OK Corral, at the end of Fremont Street. The famous gunfight that ensued lasted all of 30 seconds, and around 30 shots were fired. Though it\u2019s still debated who fired the first shot, most reports say that the shootout began when Virgil Earp pulled out his revolver and shot Billy Clanton point-blank in the chest, while Doc Holliday fired a shotgun blast at Tom McLaury\u2019s chest. Though Wyatt Earp wounded Frank McLaury with a shot in the stomach, Frank managed to get off a few shots before collapsing, as did Billy Clanton. When the dust cleared, Billy Clanton and the McLaury brothers were dead, and Virgil and Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday were wounded. Ike Clanton and Claiborne had run for the hills. [PAR] Sheriff John Behan of Cochise County, who witnessed the shootout, charged the Earps and Holliday with murder. A month later, however, a Tombstone judge found the men not guilty, ruling that they were \u201cfully justified in committing these homicides.\u201d The famous shootout has been immortalized in many movies, including Frontier Marshal (1939), Gunfight at the OK Corral (1957), Tombstone (1993) and Wyatt Earp (1994).

[PAR] Lakes in Europe [PAR] There are more than 500 000 natural lakes larger than 0.01 km2 (1 ha) in Europe. About 80\u00a0% to 90 % of these are small with a surface area of between 0.01 and 0.1 km2, whereas around 16 000 have a surface area exceeding 1 km2. Three quarters of the lakes are located in Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Karelo-Kola part of Russia. [PAR] Twenty four\u00a0European lakes have a surface area larger than 400 km2. The largest, Lake Ladoga (1), covers an area of 17 670 km2 (Map 1) and is located in the north-western part of Russia with the second largest lake in Europe, Lake Onega (2). Both lakes are considerably larger than other European lakes and reservoirs. Nevertheless, they only rank as the 18th and 22nd largest in the World. The third largest European freshwater body is the 6\u00a0450 km2 long Kuybyshevskoye reservoir (3) on the Volga.

[PAR] Lakes & reservoirs in Europe [PAR] The formation of Europe\u2019s lakes [PAR] Many natural European lakes appeared 10 000 to 15 000 years ago; being formed or reshaped by the last glacial period, the Weichsel. The ice sheet covered all of northern Europe. However, in central and southern Europe ice sheets only stretched as far as mountain ranges. As a rule, the regions comprising many natural lakes were affected by the Weichsel ice. For example, Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Karelo-Kola part of Russia have numerous lakes that account for approximately 5 % to 10 % of their national surface area. Large numbers of lakes were also created in other countries around the Baltic Sea, as well as in Iceland, Ireland and the northern and western parts of the United Kingdom. In central Europe, most natural lakes lie in mountain regions. Lakes at high altitude are relatively small whereas those in valleys are larger, for example Lac L\u00e9man, Bodensee, Lago di Garda, Lago di Como and Lago Maggiore in the Alps and Lake Prespa and Lake Ohrid in the Dinarian Alps. Two exceptions are the large lakes lying on the Hungarian Plain\u00a0\u2014 Lake Balaton and Lake Neusiedler. [PAR] European countries which were only partially affected by the glaciation period (Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, southern England, central Germany, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and the central European part of Russia) boast few natural lakes. In these areas man-made lakes, such as reservoirs and ponds, are often more common than natural lakes. Many river valleys have been dammed to create reservoirs; a large number of which have been built in mountain ranges for hydroelectric purposes. In several countries, for example the Netherlands, Germany, France, Czech Republic and Slovakia, numerous small, artificial lakes have been created by other human activities such as peat and sand quarrying, and for use as fish ponds.[DOC] [TLE] Lough Ree | lake, Ireland | Britannica.comLough Ree | lake, Ireland | Britannica.com [PAR] Lough Ree [PAR] Loch Ness [PAR] Lough Ree, lake on the River Shannon , Ireland , separating Counties Longford and Westmeath (east) from County Roscommon (west).

It is based on the British blue ensign with the Union Flag (also known as the Union Jack) in the upper left corner, and four red stars with white borders to the right. These stars represent the constellation of Crux, the Southern Cross, as it seen from New Zealand. [PAR] Initially used only on government ships, it wasn't until 1902 that it was made the official flag of New Zealand. [PAR] The need for an official New Zealand flag was first recognised when a New Zealand trading vessel was seized by customs officials in Sydney harbour. The ship had been sailing without a flag, which was a violation of British navigation laws. However New Zealand-built ships could not fly under a British flag as New Zealand was not yet a British colony. [PAR] This incensed Maori, as two important chiefs were on the ship that was seized, and the call for an official New Zealand flag gained impetus. [PAR] Flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand [PAR] The first New Zealand flag was adopted on 9 March 1834 after a vote made by the United Tribes of New Zealand. One of three flags that were initially proposed, this flag became known as the Flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand. [PAR] To Maori, the United Tribes flag signified that Britain had recognised New Zealand as an independent nation with its own flag, and had acknowledged the mana of the Maori chief. [PAR] The flag is still flown at Waitangi, site of the signing of New Zealand's founding document, The Treaty of Waitangi. [PAR] The Union Jack [PAR] Following the signing of the Treaty on 6 February 1840, which effectively made New Zealand a British colony, the Union Jack replaced the Flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand as the official flag. [PAR] However some Maori believed that they should have the right to fly the United Tribes flag alongside the Union Jack, and viewed the Union Jack as a symbol of British power over Maori. [PAR] The Union Jack remained New Zealand's flag until the passing of the New Zealand Ensign Act instituted the current flag in 1902, yet was still used regularly in New Zealand well into the 1950s. [PAR] Other New Zealand Flags [PAR] The Silver Fern [PAR] The silver fern flag is often seen at sporting fixtures involving  New Zealand teams or individuals. There are many variations, but it is typically the image of a silver fern on a black background. Although it has no formal recognition, many regard it as the unofficial flag of New Zealand. [PAR] A symbol of national pride, the silver fern emblem is also incorporated into the logos of many New Zealand sporting teams, including the All Blacks rugby team. [PAR] For several years, some people in New Zealand have been calling for a change to the official New Zealand flag that signifies New Zealand's independence from Britain. [PAR] Several variations of the silver fern flag have appeared in support of this call for a new national flag. [PAR] Tino Rangatiratanga [PAR] Since 1990, the Tino rangatiratanga flag has been used by some Maori as an alternative to the official New Zealand flag, and a symbol of Maori independence. Tino rangatiratanga's closest English translation is self-determination, although some refer to it as \"absolute sovereignty\" or \"Maori independence\". [PAR] Chosen through a competition, this New Zealand flag uses black to represent potentiality, white to represent the physical world of light and understanding, red to represent open daylight (representing the achievement of full potential and understanding), and the Koru, a spiral-like shape representing the unfolding of new life. [PAR] Featured[DOC] [TLE] 1. \u2013 Flags \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand1. \u2013 Flags \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand [PAR] National flags are a symbol of nationhood and are venerated by many.

The \"goat-man\" who gave his name to the Aegean Sea was, next to Poseidon, the father of Theseus, the founder of Athenian institutions and one of the kings of Athens. [PAR] Upon the death of the king his father, Pandion II, Aegeus and his three brothers, Pallas, Nisos, and Lykos, took control of Athens from Metion, who had seized the throne from Pandion. They divided the government in four but Aegeas became king. His first wife was Meta and the second was Chalciope. [PAR] Still without a male heir, Aegeus asked the Oracle at Delphi for advice. Her cryptic words were \"Do not loosen the bulging mouth of the wineskin until you have reached the height of Athens, lest you die of grief.\" Ignoring the oracle, Aegeus returned home by way of Troezen, where he was induced to father Theseus, perhaps drunkenly, and thus eventually did die of grief. [PAR] An ancient subjugation of Athens to Crete is explained by the myth that while visiting in Athens, King Minos' son, Androgeus \"breeder of men\", managed to defeat Aegeus in every contest during the Panathenaic Games. Out of jealousy, Aegeus sent him to conquer the Marathonian Bull, which killed him. Minos was angry and declared war on Athens. He offered the Athenians peace, however, under the condition that Athens would send seven young men and seven young women every nine years to Crete to be fed to the Minotaur, a vicious monster. This continued until Theseus killed the Minotaur with the help of Ariadne, Minos' daughter. [PAR] Aegeus' first wife was Meta and the second was Chalciope. Still without a male heir, Aegeus asked the Oracle at Delphi for advice. Her cryptic words were \"Do not loosen the bulging mouth of the wineskin until you have reached the height of Athens, lest you die of grief.\"Aegeus did not understand the prophecy and was disappointed. [PAR] Aegeus went to Troezen where he was the guest of Troezen's king Pittheus. Pittheus understood the prophecy and introduced Aegeas to his daughter, Aethra, when he was drunk. They slept with each other and then, in some versions, Aethra waded out to the sea to the island of Sphairia, and bedded also with Poseidon. When she fell pregnant, Aegeus decided to go back to Athens. Before leaving, he covered his sandals, shield and sword under a huge rock and told her that when their son grew up, he should move the rock and bring the weapons back, by which sign his father would acknowledge him. Upon his return to Athens, Aegeus married Medea who had fled from Corinth and the wrath of Jason. Aegeus and Medea had one son together named Medus. [PAR] In Troezen, Theseus grew up and became a brave young man. He managed to move the rock and took his father's arms. His mother then told him the identity of his father and that he should take the weapons back to him at Athens and be acknowledged. Theseus decided to go to Athens and had the choice of going by sea, which was the safe way, or by land, following a dangerous path with thieves and bandits all the way. Young, brave and ambitious, Theseus decided to go to Athens by land. [PAR] When Theseus arrived, he did not reveal his true identity. He was welcomed by Aegeas, who was suspicious about the stranger who came to Athens. Medea tried to have Theseus killed by encouraging Aegeas to ask him to capture the Marathonian Bull, but Theseus succeeded. She tried to poison him, but at the last second, Aegeas recognized his sword and knocked the poisoned cup out of Theseus' hand. Father and son were thus reunited, and Medea was sent away to Asia\n\n\n### Answer:\nmeta </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Thirst is everything. Obey your thirst.\" Sprite's new ad campaign focused on differentiating Sprite from its competitors by acknowledging all the ways other products were marketing themselves and telling the consumer that this was not the case with Sprite. Rather than showing people doing fun and/or incredible things while drinking the product or having celebrity endorsements, Sprite decided to focus on buying Sprite because it will quench your thirst. The new tv spots were fashioned as what Sturken & Cartwright call \"anti-ads\"(p.296).  These new types of ads tell the viewer that the company knows they understand \"how ads work and that [they] are not easily fooled\" (296), and instead of trying to fool the viewer the company, \"respects [their] intelligence and will bring [them] into the processes of meaning-making\"(296). Sprite parodied other ads by showing the \"reality\" of what was actually happening in them. One example of this is Sprite's Grant Hill commercial in which a child is shown to believe if he drinks Sprite he will have all the athletic abilities of Grant Hill. The commercial goes on to show the child ultimately failing, and states, \"drinking sprite will not make you a better athlete.\" [PAR] The commercial tells viewers not to fall for advertising gimmicks while using the gimmick of the \"anti-ad\" to sell Sprite. Sprite tries to let the views know they are choosing Sprite based on their own decisions and not because of subliminal messages or other marketing ploys, which is essentially the most manipulative marketing ploy of all.

It was once heavily wooded, giving rise to the name 'Forest of Arden'. It does not seem that the area was subject to forest law however. [PAR] History [PAR] Believed to be derived from a Brythonic word ardu- \"high\" (cf. Welsh ardd), by extension \"highland\", the area was formerly thickly forested and known as the Forest of Arden. Located near the geographical centre of England, the Forest of Arden, through which no Roman roads were built, was bounded by the Roman roads Icknield Street, Watling Street, Fosse Way, and a prehistoric salt track leading from Droitwich. It encompassed an area corresponding to the north-western half of the traditional county of Warwick, stretching from Stratford-on-Avon in the south to Tamworth (in Staffordshire) in the north, and included what are now the large cities of Birmingham and Coventry, in addition to areas that are still largely rural with numerous areas of woodland. The most important and largest settlement in the forest was the town Henley-in-Arden (in a valley of the River Alne, approximately 15 miles southeast of Birmingham), the site of an Iron Age hillfort. [PAR] An ancient mark stone known as \"Coughton Cross\" is still present at the south western corner of the forest, at the junction of Icknield Street (now A435) and the salt track.  It is located at the southern end of the frontage of Coughton Court and is owned by the National Trust.  According to local tradition, travellers prayed here for safe passage through the forest. [PAR] From around 1162, until the suppression of the order in 1312, the Knights Templar owned a preceptory at Temple Balsall in the middle of the Forest of Arden. The property then passed to the Knights Hospitaller, who held it until the Reformation during the 16th century. [PAR] Robert Catesby, leader of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, was a native of Lapworth, a village in Arden. It is believed that many local families had resisted the Reformation and retained Catholic sympathies, possibly including the family of Shakespeare, whose paternal ancestors were from Temple Balsall. [PAR] Thorkell of Arden, a descendant of the ruling family of Mercia, was one of the few major English landowners who retained extensive properties after the Norman conquest, and his progeny, the Arden family, remained prominent in the area for centuries. Mary Arden, mother of William Shakespeare, was a member. [PAR] Shakespeare's play As You Like It is set in the Forest of Arden, however it is an imaginary version incorporating elements from the Ardennes forest in Thomas Lodge's prose romance Rosalynde and the real forest (both as it was then, subjected to deforestation and enclosure, and the romanticized version of his youth). [PAR] Towns in the area include Hampton-in-Arden, Henley-in-Arden, and Tanworth-in-Arden. [PAR] Proposal for a new national forest [PAR] The Countryside Commission considered creating a new national forest in the area in 1989, but the proposal was not taken up.  A national forest has been established in the northern midlands however. [PAR] Heart of England forest [PAR] Publisher Felix Dennis planted substantial areas of woodland in the area, known as the Heart of England Forest and on his death in 2014 left most of his fortune to be used for this purpose.  3000 acres have been planted in Spernall, Dorsington and Honeybourne.[DOC] [TLE] Counties of EnglandCounties of England are areas used for the purposes of administrative, geographical and political demarcation.

Scott Fitzgerald , the American author famous for his novel, The Great Gatsby . Set between 1913 and 1930, mostly in Southern France and Switzerland, the novel tells the story of what happens when the extremes of love, madness, and ambition play out against a high-glamour backdrop, in a physical and psychological landscape torn apart by World War I . [PAR] It\u2019s hard to talk about Tender is the Night without talking about its author, his wife Zelda, and the famous people they knew, like Pablo Picasso and Ernest Hemmingway , to name a few. Fitzgerald officially began work on Tender in 1925. He agonized over it and revised it continuously even after its 1933 publication. In 1930 Zelda was admitted to a psychiatric clinic for treatment of schizophrenia. Scott finished the novel while Zelda was still under psychiatric care, and the novel reflects the anguish of Fitzgerald\u2019s experience with her mental health. [PAR] Though based in part on Fitzgerald\u2019s friends, Gerald and Sara Murphy, to whom the book is dedicated, you can\u2019t deny some of the biographical parallels between Dick and Nicole Diver, the main characters, and Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. Like Zelda, Nicole is a brilliant and ambitious woman, who is diagnosed with schizophrenia; and like Scott, Dick is a brilliant and ambitious man who feels he\u2019s not reaching the high goals he sets for himself. Like Scott, Dick is not wealthy. When Zelda and Scott were still together, Scott had an affair with a young film star, Lois Moran . Dick has an affair with Rosemary Hoyt, a young actress based on Moran. There's even a character that is widely believed to be based on Hemingway, Tommy Barban, the mercenary Nicole falls in love with. But, no, Zelda did not leave Scott for Hemingway. [PAR] The real life story of Zelda and Scott ends tragically. Scott, a heavy alcoholic (like Dick) died in 1940, at forty-four years old, of heart failure, before completing the novel he was working on, The Last Tycoon . Zelda\u2019s death was positively gruesome. She died in 1948 inside a psychiatric hospital when it caught on fire. Luckily Dick and Nicole don\u2019t die that way (or at all) in Tender is the Night \u2013 a biographical analysis of the novel can only take us so far. [PAR] You should know, though, about a unique controversy surrounding the novel. Despite its controversial content, including incest, Tender is the Night doesn\u2019t really show up on the banned lists like its younger sibling, The Great Gatsby . Maybe this is because the biggest controversy surrounding Tender is the Night has to do with time, of all things. The novel opens in 1925. We meet the Divers at their fabulous French Riviera home, and watch their endless party. It\u2019s not until the second part of the novel that we learn of Nicole\u2019s dark past, and how she and Dick met. Doesn\u2019t sound like any big deal, right? Well, the novel didn\u2019t do so well. It was published in the heart of the Great Depression , and some critics say that audiences didn\u2019t want to read about lifestyles of the rich and famous in a time of economic crisis. [PAR] Fitzgerald had a different idea of the problem. He made extensive notes for a revision, which would place the events in chronological order, but died before a revision was undertaken. Fitzgerald\u2019s friend, the American writer, critic, and journalist Malcolm Cowley decided to do it for him. Cowley revised the novel according to Fitzgerald\u2019s notes, and the revised version was published in 1951, after Fitzgerald\u2019s death. The Cowley edition can be found online here , though Shmoop is using the 1933 original version. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Why Should I Care?

[PAR] Updated February 22, 2016 [PAR] Thanatology Definition [PAR] Thanatology comprises the formal academic and/or scientific study of dying, death and how human beings respond to the inevitability of their mortality and the reality of loss across a wide spectrum of professional or educational disciplines. [PAR] The field of thanatology is very broad and generally shaped by the particular interests/professional occupations of those who engage in this study. [PAR] For example, from the scientific perspective, a medical examiner, coroner, doctor, nurse or other medical practitioner might study thanatology in order to better understand what physically happens to the human body immediately after death occurs . [PAR] On the other hand, those engaged in the social sciences -- such as psychologists, archaeologists or cultural historians -- might study thanatology in order to better understand the rites, rituals and ceremonies human beings use/have used to honor and remember loved ones who die from an individual or societal/cultural perspective. [PAR] Who Becomes a Thanatologist? [PAR] There is no single or standardized course of study in thanatology that attracts a particular type of person or group of people. As noted above, dying, death and how human beings respond to the inevitability of their mortality and cope with the reality of loss can be viewed from a wide range of perspectives. [PAR] Therefore, those who study thanatology studies can include, among others: [PAR] \u2022 Archaeologists[DOC] [TLE] List of books and articles about Thanatology | Online ...List of books and articles about Thanatology | Online Research Library: Questia [PAR] Home \u00bb Browse \u00bb Psychology \u00bb Other Types of Psychology \u00bb Thanatology [PAR] Thanatology [PAR] Thanatology is the study of death and dying, encompassing the events, thoughts, feelings and attitudes associated with the end of life. This field of work examines death from a variety of perspectives - including death's psychological, social, cultural, medical, legal and ethical aspects. [PAR] It is therefore an interdisciplinary study and a common territory of psychology, sociology, anthropology, religious studies, medicine and forensic science, using the resources and serving the needs of these and other scientific fields. The range of professionals involved in thanatology includes nursing specialists and other healthcare providers, social researchers, historians, philosophers and theologists, as well as medical researchers and forensic pathologists. [PAR] The term thanatology derives from the Greek word for death, thanatos, and logos, which means speech or discourse. Studying death as a separate scientific discipline was first proposed in 1903 by Russian biologist \u00c9lie Metchnikoff, who saw a need to study death systematically in order to complete the scope of life sciences. [PAR] The study of death, however, remained relatively unpopular until World War II, when the painful reality of death claimed the attention of researchers. An important driving force for thanatology at that point was American psychologist Herman Feifel. He is credited with breaking the taboos related to death, dying and bereavement, making them acceptable topics of discussion and establishing them as worthy subjects of study. Feifel was the editor of The Meaning of Death, a 1959-published collection of essays by renowned thinkers including Carl Jung, Paul Tillich and Herbert Marcuse that expedited the study of death and became a classic in the field. [PAR] Feifel's work was an influence to Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross, a Switzerland-born psychiatrist who studied dying patients and promoted the idea of offering them psychological counseling. In her widely successful book from 1969, On Death and Dying, K\u00fcbler-Ross identifies five mental stages through which dying people go: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. This idea, known as the K\u00fcbler-Ross model, received wide recognition among professionals working with dying patients and their families. [PAR] Another work that helped thanatology gain traction was The Psychology of Death (1972) by Robert Kastenbaum and Ruth Aisenberg. The book and its two revised editions focus on the conceptions of death. It discusses anxiety, suicide and physician-assisted death. [PAR] Much of the research undertaken in thanatology, including the work of K\u00fcbler-Ross, finds its application in the field of palliative care: the alleviation of physical and psychological suffering in order to make the\n\n\n### Answer:\ndeaths </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

La Paz was Bolivia\u2019s most populous city until the turn of the 21st century, when it was overtaken by Santa Cruz . [PAR] Founded in 1548 as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Paz (\u201cOur Lady of Peace\u201d) by the conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza on the site of an Inca village, the city was renamed La Paz de Ayacucho in 1825, in commemoration of the last decisive battle in the wars of independence. The seat of national government was established there in 1898, but Sucre remains Bolivia\u2019s constitutional capital, home to the country\u2019s Supreme Court; La Paz is the seat of the executive and legislative branches. The Plaza Murillo, on the northeastern side of the river, is the heart of the city and site of the huge modern cathedral and government and legislative palaces. Although few colonial buildings survive, the narrow, steep, older streets, red-tile roofs, many skyscrapers, and highland Indians in colourful dress, with Nevado Illimani (21,004 feet [6,402 metres]) and other snowcapped peaks of the Cordillera Real in the background, give La Paz a distinctive atmosphere. La Paz is the site of the University of San Andr\u00e9s (1830) and Bolivian Catholic University (1966). The National Museum of Art, a children\u2019s museum, the Museum of Ethnography and Folklore, the National Museum of Archaeology, and the Mercado de Brujas (\u201cWitches\u2019 Market\u201d), where herbs and other remedies used by the Aymara are sold, are among the city\u2019s cultural assets.

Here is a drawing of the basic design and construction of the gun:[DOC] [TLE] How to Choose a Shotgun: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHowHow to Choose a Shotgun: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow [PAR] A bewildering variety of shotguns and ammo are available, potentially making it difficult for someone to make a purchase. [PAR] Background Information on Shotguns [PAR] Shotgun Types [PAR] Single shot shotguns are generally the least expensive; their downfall is that they only hold one shell at a time. To fire again, you have to open the breach and insert a new shell, a time consuming activity. Still, they are a functional tool for many tasks. [PAR] Pump-action shotguns are the most common kind. They are known for their low cost (though some models can still get very expensive, they are some of the cheapest common shotguns), and reliability. After every shot you must pump the fore-end (place where you put your left hand) of the gun to eject the spent shell and load another from the magazine tube into the chamber. [PAR] Auto-loader shotguns (also known as \"semi-automatic\") use a few different types of systems so the only operation you do to fire a round is pull the trigger. Reliability is lowered and using a variety of rounds reduces reliability even more. [PAR] Double barrel shotguns come in two varieties: over-unders (O/U) with one barrel above another, and side-by-sides, in which the barrels are located horizontally. Some people prefer one style, some the other; neither is ultimately better, and both styles are expensive. [PAR] For a beginner, a pump action is probably a good place to start since it is very common, cheap, versatile, and reliable. [PAR] Shotgun Barrels [PAR] Barrel length primarily affects the handling capabilities of the shotgun. It also affects the ability to aim the shotgun accurately. [PAR] Longer barrels swing more smoothly and are considered better for predictable targets. Shorter barrels are both easier to maneuver in restricted spaces and are quicker to point; they are considered better for combat or unpredictable birds. [PAR] Longer barrels give you a longer distance from the end of the barrel to your eye, making eye alignment less critical. This makes them more accurate. [PAR] There is a slight increase in muzzle velocity with longer barrels, but it's not enough to worry about. More important is the increased flash and noise when shooting a shotgun with a short barrel. [PAR] A choke is a section at the end of the barrel which slightly constricts the diameter of the muzzle. For shot, it makes the pattern tighter, and travel further while maintaining a dense enough pattern to kill/destroy your target. There are many sizes of chokes, and a couple types of chokes which may be in a barrel. [PAR] The size of the choke changes how wide the spread of the pellets will be. The tighter the choke, generally, the tighter the pattern. Loose patterns allow for greater aiming error, but it also means that your range is more limited. [PAR] The two types of chokes are fixed chokes and screw-in chokes. Fixed chokes are part of the barrel design and cannot be changed or removed (without major work). The screw-in choke means the end of the barrel is threaded (inside the bore) to allow many different sizes of chokes to be easily replaced. [PAR] Slugs and buckshot should not be shot through both tight (improved modified, full, or extra full) fixed chokes or any type of screw-in choke; you are likely to damage the gun\n\n\n### Answer:\ngun </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] Answer: [PAR] Borscht is a vegetable soup, usually including beet roots, which give it a strong red color. However other, non-beet varieties exist, such as the tomato paste-based orange borscht and the sorrel-based green borscht. [PAR] There are local variations in the basic borscht recipe: [PAR] In Russian cuisine, it usually includes beets, often meat, and cabbage and optionally potatoes. [PAR] In Ukrainian and Belarusian the beets are standard, in addition to tomatoes. Potatoes and cabbage are both optional. It is usually served with smetana (cream), and tradition requires it to be served with small hot breads topped with fresh chopped garlic - pampushki [PAR] In Polish cuisine, the beets are not standard. Besides the Ukrainian style beet soup Polish people enjoy a white Easter borscht. White borscht is made from a base of fermented rye flour usually added to a broth of boiled white fresh kielbasa (after the base is added, the soup mustn't be boiled). It is served hot with cubed rye bread and diced hard-boiled eggs added to the broth, often horseradish is added to taste. [PAR] In East Prussia sour cream (Schmand) and beef was served with the Beetenbartsch (lit. beetroot-borscht). [PAR] In Lithuanian cuisine, dried mushrooms are often added. There is also a cold borscht (?altibar?iai) which has a very different taste and appearance. [PAR] In Romanian cuisine, it is the name for any sour soup, prepared usually with fermented wheat bran (which is also called bor?). In fact, the Romanian gastronomy uses with no discrimination the words ciorb? (Turkish), bor? or, sometimes, zeam?/acritur? (Romanian descriptives) [PAR] In Armenian cuisine, it is served warm with fresh sour cream. [PAR] In Doukhobor cuisine, the main ingredient is cabbage, and the soup also contains beets, potatoes, tomatoes and heavy cream along with dill and leeks. This style of borscht is orange in colour, and is always eaten hot. [PAR] In Hong Kong-style western cuisine, it includes tomatoes instead of beets, and also beef, cabbage, potatoes, bell peppers and carrots. Sometimes chili pepper is added. [PAR] In Mennonite cuisine, borscht is a generic term for soup. [PAR] While the base for borscht is often meat stock, this version is only suitable for non-Lenten seasons among some Christian communities that observe Lent. [PAR] A simpler vegan version made with vegetable stock is eaten during Lenten and fasting periods, which is called Fasting Borscht. [PAR] Borscht can be prepared and served either hot or cold. It is also often accompanied by sour cream (like East European smetana) or whipping cream. [PAR] beets [PAR] 2 cloves garlic, mashed [PAR] Salt to taste [PAR] Bring water to  a boil.

[PAR] Since then, the parent body of European football\u00a0\u2013 one of six continental confederations of world football's governing body FIFA\u00a0\u2013 has grown into the cornerstone of the game on this continent, working with and acting on behalf of Europe's national football associations and other stakeholders in the game to promote football and strengthen its position as the world's most popular sport. [PAR] The guiding principle of the initiators in the early 1950s was the fostering and development of unity and solidarity among the European football community. Now, six decades later, UEFA's mission remains very much the same. But it has also become the guardian of football in Europe by working closely with its 55 member associations to promote, protect and nurture the sport at all levels, from the elite and its stars to the millions who play the game as a hobby. [PAR] In 1960, UEFA had a full-time staff of just three people. That figure has risen steadily through the years as the organisation has reacted to changing circumstances. Today, 574 permanent and fixed-term staff\u00a0of 37 different nationalities (as of June 2016) \u2013 administrators, secretaries, lawyers, IT and media specialists, coaches, translators \u2013 are employed at UEFA's administrative headquarters located in the town of Nyon, on the shores of Lake Geneva in western Switzerland. The body has resided in Nyon since 1995 after beginning its life in Paris, before moving to the Swiss federal capital Berne, where UEFA stayed for over three decades from 1960. [PAR] Over the decades, UEFA has developed from a mainly administrative body into a dynamic sports organisation that is in tune with the vast requirements of modern-day football. UEFA is a sporting authority which does not have the powers of a government; it represents Europe's national football associations, and can only act in accordance with the wishes of these associations. [PAR] When UEFA was founded, the body comprised 31 national associations. The number of member associations rose gradually until the beginning of the 1990s, when political developments in eastern Europe and the fragmentation of the USSR led to a rapid growth in the number of new nation states, each with its own football association. Consequently, there are now 55 associations under UEFA's wing. [PAR] \u00a9UEFA.com 1998-2015. All rights reserved.

[PAR] View all articles by Marengo [PAR] Lilian [PAR] \u00a0Leopold was only 37 years old and had already been a widower for\u00a0three years\u00a0 when in 1938 he\u00a0became attracted\u00a0to\u00a0the elegant Lilian Baels,\u00a0who made a lasting impression on him.\u00a0In the war days of 1940\u00a0Lilian moved with her family to France, but in January 1941 Leopold's mother, Queen Elisabeth, sent her chauffeur to Biarritz to fetch Lilian. Queen Elisabeth\u00a0thought that the 24-year-old\u00a0Lilian\u00a0would be\u00a0the perfect medicine to alleviate her son's despondency. It was her task to \"distract\" the King. Soon Queen Elisabeth\u00a0discovered \"that the remedy was very mild and that the patient was not disposed to finish the treatment.\"\u00a0 Leopold was dazzled by Lilian's beauty and was very much in love with her. The affair caused some problems. First of all,\u00a0Lilian wasn't happy with the status of mistress; only marriage could bring her security. Cardinal van Roey\u00a0also tried to persuade the King to make Lilian his lawful wife, as he had religious and moral problems with the affair. So\u00a0in 1941\u00a0Leopold asked Lilian to marry him. Although Lilian had been pushing to get Leopold to propose to her, she\u00a0did not accept the proposal immediately. \"But Kings marry Princesses,\" she replied. Queen Elisabeth had to persuade her to accept the offer: \"You can't do that to my son. He needs a wife, you have to accept,\" which she did. Henri Baels, Lilian's father, realized that this marriage would cause an uproar and only gave his blessing if Queen\u00a0Elisabeth would attend the ceremony and if Cardinal\u00a0van Roey would\u00a0officiate. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] The couple married on 11 September, and Leopold's children quickly became fond of their stepmother and called her \"maman.\"\u00a0Within three months Lilian became pregnant, and as this would not\u00a0stay a secret for long, Leopold III asked Cardinal\u00a0van Roey to write a letter that was to be read from the\u00a0 pulpit\u00a0at Sunday mass in Catholic\u00a0churches throughout the country.\u00a0The Belgians were shocked.\u00a0The image of their lonely heroic King, who was struck with sorrow and humiliation and who thought only about the welfare of his people, was shattered. Suddenly the King was a selfish man who thought only of his own happiness. The second image of Leopold as\u00a0the grieving widower of the immensely popular Queen Astrid fell apart too.\u00a0The King's choice became the subject of heavy criticism: how could the King marry now?\u00a0Hadn't he said that he would share the fate of the Belgian prisoners of war? Many Walloon soldiers\u00a0were still in captivity in Germany and unable to see their wives, so how could the King remarry if he really meant what he said about wanting to share their fate?\u00a0And how could he marry a commoner, a Flemish commoner? Some members of the\u00a0upper class\u00a0joked that the King would have to include herring in his\u00a0coat of arms now that he had married the granddaughter of a fish merchant.\u00a0Lilian was immediately branded a schemer and an adventuress.\u00a0Leopold was mocked by the people as \"the son-in-law of Mr. Baels\" (Lilian's father\u00a0was an unpopular\u00a0Flemish politician who fled the country during the war to ensure his personal safety and was fired as a result).\u00a0But their anger was directed chiefly at Lilian, who was referred to as \"Lady Codfish\" and \"the fishmonger's daughter.\" Because of public indignation against the marriage, Leopold did not dare bestow\n\n\n### Answer:\nbelgium </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

They evolved in Europe and western Asia  and were introduced to North America in 1883 and to Montana in 1889 in the Madison River.  Today brown trout are  found throughout most of Montana except the northwest and parts of the east.  Generally, they prefer lower gradient,  larger streams than cutthroat and rainbow, and they also do well in many reservoirs.  Brown trout were widely stocked in  the first half of this century, but today most come from natural reproduction.  Brown trout are great competitors and  generally are more tolerant of dewatering and other environmental disturbances than our other trout species.  The state  record is 29 pounds, and large fish are not at all uncommon, although 12-20 inches is the usual size range of adults.   Brown trout spawn in gravel redds like our native trout but their spawning season is in the fall.  This gives them a  distinct advantage in some habitats since their spawning and incubation period lies outside the irrigation season.  Brown  trout are more predaceous than rainbow or cutthroat.  Large fish often feed at night on other fish as well as crayfish and  other invertebrates. [PAR] Diagnostic Characteristics [PAR] May lack red and orange spots.  Black spots may be irregularly shaped or round.  Spots with  halos on gill covers are a clue that trout is a brown trout. [PAR] Species Range [PAR] (Observations spanning multiple months or years are excluded from time charts) [PAR] Migration [PAR] May move upstream some distance or into tributary to spawn. [PAR] Habitat [PAR] Valley portions of larger rivers where gradients are low and summer temperatures range from 60-70 degrees F. Also reservoirs and lakes at similar elevation with suitable spawning trib. (Brown 1971, Holton 1981). [PAR] Food Habits [PAR] Feeds largely on underwater aquatic insects. Also uses many other small organisms available and large individuals eat many small fish (Brown 1971). [PAR] Ecology [PAR] Habitat requirements similar to brook trout, but brown trout can remain active and thriving at slightly higher temperatures (Scott and Crossman 1973). [PAR] Reproductive Characteristics [PAR] Sexually mature usually 3 years but sometimes 2,4, and 5 years. Spawns Oct.-Dec. Eggs laid in redd and hatch the following Spring. Febr.-April under natural conditions. Hatch in about 50 days at 50 degrees F. (Brown 1971). [PAR] References[DOC] [TLE] Trout Species List - Teton Valley LodgeTrout Species List - Teton Valley Lodge - [PAR] Trout Species List [PAR] The Idaho State Fish [PAR] Description [PAR] Cutthroat trout are named for the bright red-orange streak in the fold under the jaw. Cutthroat are native to mountain streams, lakes and rivers throughout Idaho. This is the primary reason for its designation as Idaho\u2019s state fish. They are great indicators of water quality, since they prefer very clean, pristine waters. They have been introduced into many of the high mountain lakes. Cutthroat prefer colder water than do the closely related rainbow trout. [PAR] Life History [PAR] Spawning takes place in the late spring in small tributary streams. The female digs a redd in the gravel with her tail. Cutthroat may spawn more than once and with different partners. Both the male and female are aggressive if other fish try to spawn too close to their redd. Once spawning has been completed, the female will use her body and tail to displace gravel upstream of her redd to cover it. They may spawn during the day or night. The eggs will hatch in about five weeks, early in the summer. The small cutthroat trout may live in the stream where they were born, migrate to another stream, or migrate to a lake. In many Idaho rivers, cutthroat will migrate in the fall, over-winter, and move back to their summer home. You may find yourself angling for cutthroat during only one season in order to find cutthroat large enough to catch. Like the rainbow, their size and age of sexual maturity varies.\n\n\n### Answer:\ntrout </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

A swimsuit, bathing suit, swimming costume, tog, bathers, or cossie (short for \"costume\") is an item of clothing designed to be worn by men, women or children while they are engaging in a water-based activity or water sports, such as swimming, water polo, diving, surfing, water skiing, or during activities in the sun, such as sun bathing. [PAR] A swimsuit can be worn as an undergarment in sports that require a wetsuit such as water skiing, scuba diving, surfing, and wakeboarding. Swimsuits are also worn when there is a need to display the body, as in the case of beauty pageants or bodybuilding contests. Glamour photography and magazines like the annual Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue feature models and sports personalities in swimsuits. [PAR] The bikini is typically a women's two-piece swimsuit. One part of the attire covers the breasts and the other part covers the crotch and part of or the entire buttocks, leaving an uncovered area between the two. Merriam--Webster describes the bikini as \"a woman's scanty two-piece bathing suit\" or \"a man's brief swimsuit\". It is often worn in hot weather, while swimming or sunbathing. The shapes of both parts of a bikini resemble women's underwear, and the lower part can range from revealing thong or g-string to briefs. [PAR] While two-piece bathing suits had been worn on the beach before, the modern bikini was invented by French engineer Louis R\u00e9ard in 1946. He named it after Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, the site of the Operation Crossroads nuclear weapon tests in July that year. [PAR] The bikini is perhaps the most popular female beachwear around the globe, according to French fashion historian Olivier Saillard due to \"the power of women, and not the power of fashion\". As he explains, \"The emancipation of swimwear has always been linked to the emancipation of women. By the mid 2000s, bikinis had become a $811 million business annually, according to the NPD Group, a consumer and retail information company. The bikini has boosted spin-off services like bikini waxing and the sun tanning industries [PAR] Predecessors of the bikini date to antiquity, in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck and the Greco-Roman world. Art dating from the Diocletian period (286--305 AD) in Villa Romana del Casale, Sicily depicts women in garments resembling bikinis in mosaics on the floor. The images of ten women, dubbed the \"Bikini Girls\", exercising in clothing that would pass as bikinis today are the most replicated mosaic among the 37 million colored tiles at the site. Archeological finds, particularly in Pompeii, show the Roman goddess Venus wearing a bikini. A statue of Venus in a bikini was found in a cupboard in the southwest corner in Casa della Venere, others were found in the front hall. A statue of Venus was recovered from the tablinum of the House of Julia Felix, and another from an atrium at the garden at Via Dell'Abbondanza. [PAR] The groundwork for the modern bikini began to be laid in 1907, when Australian swimmer and performer Annette Kellerman was arrested on a Boston beach for wearing a form-fitting one-piece swimsuit, which became an accepted beach attire for women by 1910. In 1913, inspired by the introduction of women into Olympic swimming, designer Carl Jantzen made the first functional two-piece swimwear, a close-fitting one-piece with shorts on the bottom and short sleeves on top. [PAR] By the 1930s, necklines plunged at the back, sleeves disappeared and sides were cut away. Hollywood endorsed the new glamour with films such as Neptune's Daughter in which Esther Williams wore provocatively named costumes such as \"Double Entendre\" and \"Honey Child\".

Stereotypes surrounding modernity and progress centralized issues which became apparent in the post world Middle East. During this time, the activities of the Great Powers in the Middle East, specifically the removal of economic development institutions after some positive advancement became evident, encouraged many political groups to organize against the politicians who dominated the parliamentary politics of the time. Workers had become accustomed to development efforts which were meant to stabilize the economy of the region. The state led initiatives set the standard for what the people expected of their government including the regulation of imports, industrial investment, and commodity distribution and production supervision. [1] [PAR] Formation [PAR] Politicians and government bodies were forced to respond to the demands of groups who were directly affected by the initiative changes and withdrawals. Some of these groups included military officers. While the first military coups began its mission in Syria in the late 1940's, it was the Free Officers coup in Egypt and the revolution of 1952 that would have the greatest impact and encourage later movements. [1] The members were not of the wealthy elite, but rather the middle class, young workers, government officials and junior officers. The movement, which began and spread throughout the 1940\u2019s, came to fruition with the help and leadership of Gamal Abdel Nasser . Nasser formed a coordinating committee (1949), of which he was acclaimed head (1950). He was respected by the party and its followers. Coming from a modest background he signified the groups majority; the hard working middle class. The Free Officers consisted of urban dwellers and educated militants with a lower middle class upbringing. He was a war hero who rose quickly in military rank to colonel. He like many others dedicated his time and energy to reverse the corruption and sleaze seen on the part of the government throughout the 1948 Palestine war by restoring a democracy. He saw the problem of domestic passive reaction to imperialism as much a problem as imperialism itself. [1] They strengthened a \u201cnew\u201d middle class. Due to this dedication toward change, the Free Officers referred to their group and its entirety as simply a \u201cmovement.\u201d Later however, it would become a revolution . [PAR] The Free Officers Committee enlisted General Muhammad Naguib as a public figurehead in preparation for the successful coup of July 23, 1952.

Anyone who performs repetitive movements of the elbow, like a carpenter or painter, or who repeatedly moves the                                  wrist forward and backward, such as tennis players on their backhand stroke, is susceptible. Such motions can strain tendons                                  in the arm. Over time, the strain causes inflammation of the muscles and soft tissues around the elbow, and can also cause                                  muscles in the arm to become unbalanced. [PAR] Ideally, extensor muscles, which                                  pull the wrist up, work with equal force to flexor muscles, which pull the wrist down. But when one group is weaker than the                                  other, problems can develop. With tennis elbow, the extensor muscle group on the outside of the forearm often becomes weak                                  or relatively weaker than the flexor muscles on the inner forearm, leading to a muscle imbalance and ultimately inflammation                                  and pain. [PAR] Tennis elbow can also develop                                  in people who have good muscle balance but overuse their wrist extensor muscles. This is commonly referred to as a repetitive                                  strain injury, and also leads to inflammation. Regardless of the cause, however, we can decrease inflammation, restore proper                                  muscle balance if necessary and help improve your pain-free range of motion. [PAR] Medial epicondylitis [PAR] Medial epicondylitis                                  commonly affects golfers, baseball pitchers and almost anyone who overuses his or her wrist or elbow during work or sports.                                  In the case of baseball, think of a pitcher winding up, throwing his arm back and releasing the ball as he brings his arm                                  round and snaps his wrist downwards. This motion is wrist flexion. If the pitcher wants the ball to curve to the side he's                                  throwing from (what pitchers call a screw ball), he'll have to snap his wrist inward as well, as if he were unscrewing a light                                  bulb. This motion is wrist pronation. Movements combining flexion and pronation are the major cause of medial epicondylitis. [PAR] Patients with the condition feel                                  pain in the elbow, on the inside where there's a bony bump. They also commonly have an ache or pain around the inside of their                                  elbow joint and possibly in the surrounding muscles. When they lift their wrist with the palm up, as if they were picking                                  up a table, the pain worsens, and movements that involve flexion or pronation can be unbearable. [PAR] Any activity that involves repetitive                                  flexion and pronation, like hammering, golfing and playing tennis, can lead to medial epicondylitis. During these activities,                                  excessive force on the wrist flexors, which are muscles that connect the wrist to the elbow, can strain the inner part of                                  the elbow joint. The body reacts to this strain with painful inflammation. [PAR] If left untreated, the condition can become chronic, so it's important                                  to deal with this properly. We use a variety of management techniques and often prescribe exercises and therapy to support                                  and strengthen the elbow joint.

The railway has been out of service since 1984, and has been partly dismantled. There has been talk about restoring the railway, but there is currently no indication of any restorative work underway. [PAR] History [PAR] The Transandine Railway was first projected in 1854, but the construction of the line came many years later. It was initiated by Juan and Mateo Clark, Chilean brothers of British descent, successful entrepreneurs in Valparaiso who in 1871 built the first telegraph service across the Andes, between Mendoza in Argentina and Santiago in Chile. [PAR] In 1874 the Chilean government granted them the concession for the construction of the rail link. Because of financial problems, their company, Ferrocarril Trasandino Clark, did not begin work on the construction in Los Andes until 1887. The section between Mendoza and Uspallata was opened on 22 February 1891 and extended to Rio Blanco on 1 May 1892, to Punta de Vacas on 17 November 1893, to Las Cuevas on 22 April 1903.  On the Chilean side the section from  Santa Rosa de Los Andes to Hermanos Clark was opened in 1906, and extended to Portillo in February 1908. The entire line was first opened to traffic in 1910.  By then the company had been taken over by the British-owned Argentine Transandine Railway Company.   [PAR] The line followed roughly the ancient route taken by travellers and mule-trains crossing the Andes between Chile and Argentina and connected the broad gauge, , railway networks of the two countries, rising to a height of almost 3,200 metres at Las Cuevas where the track entered the Cumbre tunnel, about 3.2\u00a0km long, on the international border.   Nine sections of rack were laid in the last 40\u00a0km of track on the Argentine approach to the tunnel, ranging from 1.2\u00a0km to 4.8\u00a0km in length,  with a maximum gradient of 1 in 17 (5.88%).  On the Chilean side there were seven sections of rack in just 24\u00a0km, of which one section was 16\u00a0km long with an average gradient of 1 in 13 (7.69%).

Set in 1885 New Mexico, this dark, bristling adventure stars Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones as two unlikely allies: a tough, grieving frontier mother and her despised, long-absent father, joined on a hunt for the woman\u2019s missing teenage daughter who has been kidnapped by a band of renegade Apache scouts for sale into slavery in Mexico. [PAR] Maggie Gilkeson and Samuel Jones are richer, deeper and more memorable than the people we usually see in adventure movies. Maggie, wonderfully played by Blanchett, is a hard, embittered frontierswoman who rules the roost on her isolated ranch, living with her lover Brake (Aaron Eckhart) and her teenage and preteen daughters Lilly and Dot (Evan Rachel Wood of \u201cThirteen\u201d and Jenna Boyd). Samuel is the man who made her bitter, the father who left her family 20 years ago to live among the Indians and now turns up snakebit and needing care. But, soon after, when Brake is killed and Lilly taken, Maggie turns to Samuel for help in tracking down and rescuing her daughter. [PAR] The first part of the movie is packed with horrific images evoking something we rarely saw in the first golden heyday of the movie western (1940\u201362): a west that is vast, cold, lonely and full of danger. As the tiny posse\u2014Maggie, Samuel and Dot\u2014heads south the picture moves from a landscape strikingly wintry and violent, full of black trees and glowering skies, to an inferno of rock-strewn deserts and towering hills. It\u2019s the deadly site of the inevitable final showdown with the outlaw leader and Apache witch Pesh-Chidin (Eric Schweig). [PAR] But, though the images of \u201cThe Missing\u201d are majestic, it\u2019s the characters that make the film so unusual: not just Maggie and Samuel, but selfish daughter Lilly, the terrifying and supernaturally gifted Pesh-Chidin and his mixed-race gang, Samuel\u2019s old Apache friend Kayitah (Jay Tavare) and, in a juicy cameo, Val Kilmer as U.S. Cavalry Lt. Ducharme, whose troop becomes almost tragically involved in the hunt. [PAR] The material of \u201cThe Missing,\u201d based on the 1995 novel \u201cThe Last Ride\u201d by Thomas Eidson, is very reminiscent of John Ford\u2019s \u201cThe Searchers,\u201d the 1956 western classic with John Wayne as the Civil War veteran and loner Ethan Edwards, obsessively hunting the Comanches who stole his niece Debbie. The movie is regarded by many (including me) as the greatest of all movie westerns. But, despite some direct references (including Maggie\u2019s last speech), \u201cThe Missing\u201d is no slavish homage. Indeed, it\u2019s a picture that often seems to be a critical, modernist response to \u201cThe Searchers\u201d: a feminist, pro-Native American variation on the theme. [PAR] Blanchett\u2019s Maggie, like her recent portrait of Veronica Guerin, is almost furiously self-sufficient, brave and driven, frontierswoman as avenging angel. Jones\u2019 Samuel, who gains his wisdom from his shifting position between the white and Apache worlds, is almost as powerful and mysterious as Wayne\u2019s Ethan and more realistically drawn. Schweig, the excellent part-Inuit actor who played Uncas in Michael Mann's exciting 1992 film \u201cThe Last of the Mohicans,\u201d is a scarier villain than \u201cThe Searchers\u2019\u201d Scar, a bottomlessly evil, hideously pocked nemesis with terrifying supernatural gifts. [PAR] A good part of the contemporary audience, people who like \u201cThe Searchers\u201d well enough but find parts of it old-fashioned and corny, will probably and mistakenly prefer \u201cThe Missing,\u201d a movie more respectful of Native American culture, more even-handed and modern in portraying women and more skeptical of manifest destiny, machismo and the myth of the frontier.

It has a distinctive gently curved, black snout which is about \u00bd the length of the body. [PAR] Boll weevils can be distinguished from other weevils by the two spurs on its front legs [PAR] Just behind the head, the thorax normally has a light whitish stripe that ends where the thorax joins the abdomen. The body of the boll weevil is covered with short, tan brown and grey scales which give it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The boll weevil can be distinguished from many other weevils by the spurs on its front legs.\u00a0 Many weevils have a spur at this location, but only the boll weevil and a few of its close relatives have a double spur. Adult weevils vary in size from slightly more than 1/8 inch to almost \u00bd inch in length. [PAR] Boll weevil grub feeding in a square [PAR] Immature stages of the boll weevil live inside squares and bolls where they are protected from most natural enemies and insecticides. Eggs are seldom seen since they are small and are deposited inside a square or boll. The larva is a small, white, c-shaped, legless grub with a tan to brown head and chewing mouthparts. Grubs vary in size from very small to \u00bd inch in length. The pupae or \u201cresting\u201d stage of the boll weevil is 3/8 to \u00bd inch long and cream colored. With dark eyes and a snout already formed, it has begun to develop the characteristics of the adult stage. [PAR] The adult boll weevil spends the winter in hibernation, called \u201cdiapause,\u201d without food and returns to cotton in the early spring the following year. In areas where winters are warm and host cotton is available, reproduction can occur throughout the year.\u00a0 Overwintering quarters usually consist of fence rows, broadleaved plant litter along creek bottoms, ditch banks and other protected, wooded areas near cotton fields. In the spring overwintered boll weevil adults concentrate in early planted fields nearest overwintering habitat where cotton is squaring. Adult boll weevils feed on tender growth in plant terminals if the young cotton does not have squares. In the early season, boll weevils colonize localized spots and do not generally invade the entire field. [PAR] Despite having boll in it\u2019s name, the boll weevil prefers to feed on and lay eggs in squares.\u00a0 The boll weevil is a pollen feeder; its survival is diminished without squaring cotton, although adult boll weevils emerging from overwintering quarters may subsist on other plants for short periods (e.g., an average of 18 days on yellow woolywhite in the Rolling Plains area). After adult weevils feed on cotton for 3 to 7 days and mate, they lay eggs in squares that have reached at least the \u201cone-third grown stage\u201d (approximately 1/4 inch in diameter). Egg laying may occur in smaller squares; however, sufficient feeding material is not available for a high percentage of larvae to develop to the adult stage. Late in the season eggs may be laid in small bolls, but squares are preferred. [PAR] Boll weevil egg punctures [PAR] It takes the eggs 2.5 to 5 days to hatch into the grublike larva that feeds inside the square or small boll. After larval development begins the infested square turns yellow, bracts open or flare and the fruiting form falls off the plant. The larva feeds for 7 to 14 days before pupating inside the square or small boll. During the next 4 to 6 days the pupal stage changes into an adult boll weevil. The newly developed adult eats its way out of the square or small boll and feeds on other fruiting forms for about 5 days. During this time the weevil mates and females begin to lay eggs. The entire cycle takes 16 to 18 days under ideal conditions. Six or seven generations may be produced each year with each female having the capability of laying approximately 200 eggs.

[PAR] If there\u2019s one thing everyone knows about mountains\u2014and given the state of geography education today, that may be a pretty accurate estimate\u2014it\u2019s that Mount Everest, in the Himalayas, is the Earth\u2019s highest point. But what if it wasn\u2019t? What if Everest, with its famous 29,029-foot peak, was actually dwarfed by a mountain you\u2019ve probably never even heard of, an Ecuadorian volcano called Chimborazo? [PAR] View Mount Chimborazo in a larger map [PAR] Mount Chimborazo is an Andean stratovolcano in central Ecuador, looming so impressively over the country that, on a clear day, you can see it all the way from the large port city of Guayaquil, 90 miles away. Chimborazo is Ecuador\u2019s highest point, but in terms of elevation, it\u2019s far from the highest peak in the Andes. In fact, there are almost 40 more impressive mountains in South America, many of which (like Aconcagua, the continent\u2019s highest peak) are located farther south, near the Chile-Argentina border. [PAR] So how is the 30-somethingth highest mountain in the Andes simultaneously the highest point on Earth? The central problem here is that Pythagoras, Columbus, and your elementary school teachers were all wrong: Earth isn\u2019t really round. Well, it\u2019s round-ish, but it\u2019s not a sphere. The combined effects of gravity and rotational centrifugal force have pushed the Earth\u2019s mass outward around its middle. Imagine hula-hooping for a few hours after a big Thanksgiving dinner and you\u2019ll get the idea. The resulting shape is often called an \u201coblate ellipsoid\u201d: slightly flatter at the poles and bulgier at the equator than you\u2019d expect. [PAR] This bulge isn\u2019t huge\u2014a deviation of about one part in 300 from a perfect sphere\u2014but it\u2019s enough to mess with cartography. Chimborazo tops out at 20,702 feet, almost two miles lower than Everest. But that\u2019s only compared to sea level. If we take the equatorial bulge into account\u2014in other words, if we measure what peak is farthest from the center of the Earth\u2014Chimborazo sticks more than 7,000 feet farther into space than any of the Himalayas do, since they\u2019re located thousands of miles north of the Equator. So, to quote Obi-Wan Kenobi, \u201cwhat I told you was true\u2014from a certain point of view.\u201d [PAR] Hawaiians are quick to point out that Mauna Kea, the volcano that forms the peak of the state\u2019s big island, is also taller than Everest\u2014if you measure from its base. Everest only rises about 13,000 feet above its base, less than half of Mauna Kea\u2019s 33,000-foot rise. The problem, of course, is that the Hawaiian mountain\u2019s \u201cbase camp\u201d sleeps with the fishes at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.

Known as Siam until 1939, Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country never to have been taken over by a European power. In 1932 a bloodless coup transformed the government of Thailand from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy. Thailand was occupied by the Japanese during World War II until Japan's defeat in 1945. Since after the war, the country has seen turbulent times. The military governed, on and off, between 1947 and 1992 - a period characterized by coups, coup attempts and popular protests. In September 2006, the military once again stepped into politics, carrying out a bloodless coup against Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. An interim prime minister was appointed a month later.\u00a0 Multi-party elections held in December 2007 subsequently restored democratic governance, although instability has continued at times.* Traditionally an agrarian nation, Thailand today boasts a complex, multifaceted economy embracing industries that employ the latest and most sophisticated technology. Its principal comparative advantage has been the abundance and diversity of its natural resources. With the government providing infrastructure support and exerting relatively limited control over private industry, a free-enterprise system has emerged, allowing rapid development to take place. [PAR] * Note on the 2006 coup and its after-effects -- [PAR] Modern Thailand has politically been marked by divisions between the Bangkok-based royalist establishment (whose supporters are known as \"yellow shirts\") and the less wealthy and rural Thais, known as \"red shirts\" and who have been loyal to politicians of the Shinawatra family. [PAR] In 2006, anti-government protesters known as \"yellow shirts\" took to the streets to rally for the ousting of then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.\u00a0 Thanksin Shinawatra's record at the helm of Thailand was marked partially be successful economic stewardship as well as a litany of corruption charges.\u00a0 Later in that year, Thaksin\u00a0 was ousted from office in a military coup. Still, the \"yellow shirts\" were not able to force Thaksin forces fully from government since Thaksin allies won the first post-coup elections at the close of 2007.\u00a0 In 2008, the \"yellow shirts\" again launched anti-government protests. By the close of 2008, they were able to spur the fall of the Thaksin-allied government.\u00a0 It was at that time that Abhisit Vejjajiva formed a new\u00a0 government. [PAR] Since 2009, activists loyal to Thaksin, known as \"red shirts,\" commenced their own demonstrations aimed at bringing down the current government, which was itself formed from the same protest dynamic. The situation had devolved into instability marked by violence and bloodshed, with hopes for reconciliation abandoned.\u00a0 While the military brought the protests to an end,\u00a0 Thailand was yet to escape fully from\u00a0 a state of political\u00a0\u00a0 crisis. [PAR] By mid-2010,\u00a0 conflict between the two sides erupted once again, with violent repercussions and the deaths of close to 100 people. The opposition (\"red shirts\") argued that the prime minister and his government should be blamed for resorting to the use of live ammunition against\u00a0\u00a0 them.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva survived a no-confidence vote in the lower chamber of parliament following a\u00a0 two-day censure debate in parliament over the\u00a0 hard line crackdown carried out by the government against the \"red-shirts\" protesters. [PAR] In 2011, the Thai people had registered their political allegiances at the ballot box. In those elections, the Thai people elected the Pheu Thai Party of Yingluck Shinawatra -- sister of the ousted former\u00a0 Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The election outcome constituted vindication for the \"red shirt\" supporters of Thaksin Shinawatra, who have commanded strong support at the polls for years, but who have been thwarted by the \"yellow shirts\" from being allowed to retain power, starting with the coup d'etat in 2006. It was also something of a repudiation against the hardline military intervention associated with the \"yellow shirts\" and their political leadership.

He says that he will have peace there, for peace drops from \u201cthe veils of morning to where the cricket sings.\u201d Midnight there is a glimmer, and noon is a purple glow, and evening is full of linnet\u2019s wings. He declares again that he will arise and go, for always, night and day, he hears the lake water lapping \u201cwith low sounds by the shore.\u201d While he stands in the city, \u201con the roadway, or on the pavements grey,\u201d he hears the sound within himself, \u201cin the deep heart\u2019s core.\u201d [PAR] Form [PAR] \u201cThe Lake Isle of Innisfree\u201d is written mostly in hexameter, with six stresses in each line, in a loosely iambic pattern. The last line of each four-line stanza shortens the line to tetrameter, with only four stresses: \u201cAnd live alone in the bee-loud glade.\u201d Each of the three stanzas has the same ABAB rhyme scheme. Formally, this poem is somewhat unusual for Yeats: he rarely worked with hexameter, and every rhyme in the poem is a full rhyme; there is no sign of the half-rhymes Yeats often prefers in his later work. [PAR] Commentary [PAR] \u201cThe Lake Isle of Innisfree,\u201d published in Yeats\u2019s second book of poems, 1893\u2019s The Rose, is one of his first great poems, and one of his most enduring. The tranquil, hypnotic hexameters recreate the rhythmic pulse of the tide. The simple imagery of the quiet life the speaker longs to lead, as he enumerates each of its qualities, lulls the reader into his idyllic fantasy, until the penultimate line jolts the speaker\u2014and the reader\u2014back into the reality of his drab urban existence: \u201cWhile I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey.\u201d The final line\u2014\u201cI hear it in the deep heart\u2019s core\u201d\u2014is a crucial statement for Yeats, not only in this poem but also in his career as a whole. The implication that the truths of the \u201cdeep heart\u2019s core\u201d are essential to life is one that would preoccupy Yeats for the rest of his career as a poet; the struggle to remain true to the deep heart\u2019s core may be thought of as Yeats\u2019s primary undertaking as a poet.

The Sherlock Holmes of the stories had a pipe-rack to hold all his pipes in \u2018A Case of Identity\u2019 and \u2018The Adventure of the Empty House\u2019 while in \u2018The Adventure of the Dying Detective\u2019 he had a litter of pipes on the mantelpiece. In \u2018The Red-Headed League\u2019, \u2018A Case of Identity\u2019, \u2018The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\u2019, \u2018The Hound of the Baskervilles\u2019, not by name though most likely \u2018The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist,\u2019 \u2018The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\u2019, \u2018The Valley of Fear,\u2019 and \u2018The Adventure of the Creeping Man\u2019 Holmes smoked an old, unsavoury, and oily black clay pipe, which was \u201cto him as a counsellor\u201d and \u201ccompanion of his deepest meditations.\u201d In \u2018The Adventure of the Copper Beeches\u2019 it was a \u201clong cherrywood\u00a0pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood.\u201d In \u2018The Sign of Four\u2019, \u2018The Man with the Twisted Lip,\u2019 and \u2018The Adventure of the Priory School\u2019 Holmes smoked an amber-stemmed, briar-root pipe. The curve-stemmed pipe made famous by William Gillette (on stage) and Frederic Dorr Steele (in Collier\u2019s Magazine) among others known as the Calabash or Meerschaum pipe is never mentioned in the stories nor is it drawn by Sidney Paget or any other in the Strand Magazine.

As it is told by Watson, Holmes rarely smoked cigars, but he was in the regular habit of offering them to others. On only three occasions (in \u2018The Adventure of the Empty House,\u2019 \u2018The Adventure of the Gold Pince-Nez,\u2019 and \u2018The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\u2019) is it recorded that Holmes actually enjoyed a cigar, but we may presume that Holmes often joined in when he did offer cigars to others. Those times when cigars are smoked is generally during a relaxed conversation either in the course of or at the conclusion of an investigation.

It is also referred to as phycology. It is a sub-discipline of botany since algae are more closely related to plants rather than other groups, such as animals. They are similar to plants in having body parts akin to plants. They have structures similar to roots, stems, and leaves of higher plants. The difference is the absence of a vascular system , which is found in higher plants. They possess chlorophyll pigments, which make them capable of photosynthesis . They also have accessory pigments that account for their characteristic color. For instance, the green algae have abundant chlorophyll a and b pigments. The brown algae have more brown pigments, fucoxanthin. Red algae that appear pink or red in colour because of the abundance of the pigments phycocyanin and phycoerythrin. One of the primary aspects of phycology is the identification and classification of algal species. In the old system of classification, i.e. five kingdom scheme of classification, the algae, together with the protozoa , belong to Kingdom Protista .  They are distinct from the protozoa by being photosynthetic . The algae are subdivided into various phyla : Euglenophyta ( euglenids ), Chrysophyta ( diatoms ), Pyrrophyta ( dinoflagellates ), Chlorophyta ( green algae ), Phaeophyta ( brown algae ), and Rhodophyta ( red algae ). The Cyanophyta or blue-green algae , which are prokaryotic organisms , are traditionally included in this group but in modern classification , they are now grouped together with bacteria under Kingdom Monera .

Baloo, a bear, is the strict teacher of the cubs of the Seeonee wolf pack. His most challenging pupil is the \"man-cub\" Mowgli. Baloo and Bagheera, a panther, save Mowgli from Shere Khan the tiger and endeavor to teach Mowgli the Law of the Jungle in many of the The Jungle Book stories.  [PAR] Name and species [PAR] He is described in Kipling's work as \"the sleepy brown bear\". Robert Armitage Sterndale, from whom Kipling derived most of his knowledge of Indian fauna, used the Hindi word \"Bhalu\" for several bear species, though Daniel Karlin, who edited the Penguin reissue of The Jungle Book in 1989, states that, with the exception of colour, Kipling's descriptions of Baloo are consistent with the sloth bear, as brown bears and Asian black bears do not occur in the Seoni area where the novel takes place. Also, the name sloth can be used in the context of sleepiness. Karlin states, however, that Baloo's diet of \"only roots and nuts and honey\" is a trait more common to the Asian black bear than to the sloth bear.  Nevertheless, this may be single observation only; according to the dietary habits of sloth bears, while sloth bears prefer termites and ants (which is also described as Baloo's special treat in The Jungle Book), their main sources of food are honey and fruits most of the year. [PAR] In the 2016 adaptation, Baloo is stated to be a sloth bear by Bagheera, though his appearance is similar to that of a Himalayan brown bear. Though this subspecies of the brown bear is absent from historical records on Seoni, it might have ranged across most of northern India.  [PAR] In film, television, and theatre [PAR] Disney animated films [PAR] Baloo, based on Kipling's creation, has appeared in various Disney productions, starting with that company's 1967 feature-length animated film The Jungle Book. In this version, Baloo (voiced by Phil Harris) is a friendly and even-tempered character who shirks responsibility; seemingly far removed from the law teacher in Kipling's book. Baloo is one of Mowgli's mentors and friends. Baloo is patient and strong; his only weakness is that he's ticklish. Baloo is initially opposed to bringing Mowgli to the Man Village, wanting to raise him as a son. However, when Bagheera mentions that Mowgli is easy prey for Shere Khan the tiger and that he's not safe in the jungle, even with him, Baloo realizes that he's right, and tries to tell Mowgli the difficult truth. Mowgli turns on Baloo and runs away, prompting him and Bagheera to split up and search for the boy. Baloo isn't seen again until the climax of the film, when he sees Mowgli preparing to battle Shere Khan. Baloo attempts to stop the tiger and almost gets killed in the process. After Mowgli follows a girl named Shanti into the village and decides to stay there, Baloo is slightly disappointed, but relieved that Mowgli is safe at last. He and Bagheera then return to the jungle as they sing \"The Bare Necessities\" together. [PAR] Baloo returns in the 2003 animated sequel The Jungle Book 2 in which he is voiced by John Goodman. He is eager to reunite with Mowgli, in spite of Bagheera's exasperation and the return of a vindictive Shere Khan, humiliated by his previous defeat at Mowgli's hands. He sneaks into the Man Village at night after eluding Bagheera and Colonel Hathi's herd to visit Mowgli and takes him off into the jungle after being caught by Shanti, who felt bad for getting Mowgli in trouble, and unknowingly saves him from Shere Khan, who also came to the village. This leads Shanti, Ranjan, and the villagers to go into the jungle to search for him. Mowgli tells Baloo all about the negative aspects of the village while hiding his actual feelings about the place.

Or Texas-Western\u2019s basketball team being the first team to start all 5 black players and win the NCAA Championship. They defied the impossible twice in one shot. They defied segregation and beat Adolf Rupp and his University of Kentucky Wildcats. Finally, when the New York Giants won all of their playoff games on the road and then made one of the most memorable comebacks in the history of sports by defeating the Patriots in the Super Bowl. The perfect story of David and Goliath; where David made impossible easy and beat Goliath. These are all great examples of beating the impossible. And everyone can do the impossible if they really put their mind to it. Just like all of these teams made impossible nothing. [PAR] I know of a time where impossible became nothing to me. A few months ago, in a soccer game, my team was playing the returning state champions, New Canaan. Since it was the last game of the season, I came in with the mindset of making this a game to remember. Earlier in the season we had a great comeback to a team that was about the same skill level as us. But this game would be remembered much more. Just as soon as the game started, New Canaan went up 2-0. Right before halftime, a long ball was played into the box. It found its way into the back of the net via one of our player\u2019s heads. 2-1. After that our team knew we could beat the impossible. A quick two goals with 20 minutes left in the game gave us the confidence to finish of our opponents 4-2. We had taken impossible, rolled it into a ball, and punted it into the ocean. [PAR] Defying the impossible is something everyone in the world can achieve. As long as they put all of their guts into what they really want, and focus on reaching that one goal. Whether you are attempting to break some record or do something no one has ever done before. Or even defy all of the odds put against you. The odds don\u2019t matter. What other people say doesn\u2019t matter. It comes down to what you are willing to do to reach your goal and how far you are willing to go to make impossible nothing. Because, impossible is nothing.

The reason for this is because there is an alternative food which is very delicious. Do you have any idea? It is called lumpfish roe. These are simply the eggs of a lumpfish. These eggs are treated before they are released to the market, and the treatment of lumpfish roe is done through salting and then canning. The salting is just a little bit, and that is why it is advisable to refrigerate the eggs in order to maintain the freshness. [PAR] Preparing a lumpfish roe delicacy [PAR] Just like with every other meal that you want to prepare to impress and satisfy the taste of your family and friends, you will need to prepare everything when making a lumpfish roe meal. Follow the instructions carefully and get the right equipments and ingredients. You can achieve the same satisfaction that comes with having the real caviar that is prepared with the sturgeon's unfertilized eggs. [PAR] The meaning of the word caviar [PAR] Caviar is the roe of a particular fish, and it originated from the Persians, who originally pronounced it as \u201cchav-jar\". The translation of it is \u201ca piece of power\", and it could only be eaten for medication purposes because they believed that it provided them with stamina. Lumpfish roe was a special delicacy for the upper class people in the community, and it was very rare to find it in the homes of peasants. They used to use it as an appetizer, usually served with bread. Actually the fact that there are a lot of benefits that come with eating lumpfish roe is more important than the fact that the food is tasty. [PAR] Major use of lumpfish roe [PAR] Apart from lumpfish roe and roe from sturgeon, there are other 24 main species in the Caspian Sea, whose eggs are also used to prepare caviar. The difference comes depending on which country the delicacy comes from. Consuming lumpfish roe has a number of benefits due to the various minerals that are contained in this delicacy. It contains selenium, phosphorous, magnesium, calcium, and vitamins like for example A, C and D. The food does not contain fat or carbohydrates. Amino acids like histadine and arginine are also found in this type of food. The serving of caviar should however be moderate because it contains sodium and cholesterol, which when taken in huge quantities will have side effects on your body. The main advantage of eating lumpfish roe is the ability of the food to revitalize the facial skin and that is one way we can care for our skins in a natural way without using the industrial chemical products. Some cosmetics are actually developed from the components found in the lumpfish roe. In addition to this, your body will take in the components without experiencing any allergy-related side effects.[DOC] [TLE] What is Lumpfish Roe? (with pictures) - wiseGEEKWhat is Lumpfish Roe?

It is a favorite for ballet recitals and professional ballet companies alike. Although the ballet was composed in 1876, most performances of Swan Lake today are actually based on the 1895 revival version of the ballet. If you have ever wondered who composed Swan Lake and the later revival version that is best known today, continue reading to discover the answer. [PAR] Who composed Swan Lake? [PAR] The original composition for Swan Lake was completed by the famous Russian composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky. He began work on Swan Lake in 1875 and finished it in 1876. The first performance of Swan Lake was in 1877 at the famous Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. The choreography of the original production was completed by Julius Reisinger. [PAR] There was talk about revising Swan Lake in the late 1880\u2032s and early 1890\u2032s, but Tchaikovsky died in 1893 and historians do not know whether he was planning to revise the score himself. The 1895 revival of Swan Lake is still mostly based on the Tchaikovsky composition, but was heavily revised by Italian composer Riccardo Drigo. Drigo made some considerable changes, including lengthening and shortening passages of the composition. The choreography of the 1895 Swan Lake revival was completed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov (2nd and 4th scenes). It has since become one of the greatest ballets of all time.

What little information that could be found exists in a handful of letters and memos.\u00a0Like The Nutcracker , Swan Lake was unsuccessful after its first year of performance. Conductors, dancers, and audiences alike thought Tchaikovsky's music was far too complicated and the ballet dancers in particular had difficulty dancing to the music.

[1] Parker's management of Presley defined the role of masterminding talent management which involved every facet of his life and was seen as central to the astonishing success of Presley's career. The \"Colonel\" displayed a ruthless devotion to his client's interests and took far more than the traditional 10 percent of his earnings (reaching up to 50 percent by the end of Presley's life). Presley said of Parker: \"I don't think I would have been very big with another man. Because he's a very smart man.\" [2] For many years Parker claimed to have been U.S.-born, but it eventually emerged that he was born in Breda , Netherlands . [PAR] Contents [PAR] Edit [PAR] In early 1955, Parker became aware of a young singer by the name of Elvis Presley. [3] Presley had a singing style that was different from the current trend, and Parker was immediately interested in the future of this musical style. [3] Elvis\u2019s first manager was guitarist Scotty Moore, who was encouraged by Sun Records owner Sam Phillips to become his manager to protect Elvis from unscrupulous music promoters. [4] In the beginning, Elvis was part of a trio named Blue Moon Boys, the other two members being Moore and bassist Bill Black. However, when Elvis signed a recording contract with Phillips, Moore and Black were excluded from the contract. Phillips told them to make a separate deal with Elvis. [5] According to Moore, Elvis agreed to take 50 percent, with Moore and Black splitting the other 50 percent. [6] Moore\u2019s one-year management contract with Elvis provided him with a 10 percent commission, which Moore said he never took. The contract, dated July 12, 1954, eight days after their first recording session, was signed by Elvis and his mother and father. [7] When the contract expired, Memphis radio personality Bob Neal stepped in and made a deal with Phillips to become Elvis\u2019s manager. At that point, Moore and Black had no contractual ties to either Phillips or Elvis. [8] Presley's new manager, Bob Neal, was struggling at the time to accommodate the success of his client, and in February 1955, following a meeting with Parker, he agreed to let Colonel Tom Parker take some control of future bookings and promotions. [3] Parker and Neal worked together to promote Presley, using their own Hank Snow Tour to book him and tour him. [3] Although Neal remained Presley's official manager, Parker was becoming increasingly involved in the running of his career, and by the summer of 1955 he had become \"Special Advisor\" to Presley. [3] Part of his role was to secure a new recording contract with a bigger label. [3] Presley had been at Sun Records since the beginning of his career, but Sam Phillips , the owner of Presley's current label, was aware that for Presley to have any kind of a successful future in the business he would need the backing of a much larger label. [3] Despite this, Phillips was not keen to let him go easily, advising Parker that he would require $40,000 to secure the release of Presley's contract, a completely unheard of sum at the time. [3] Parker immediately got to work on finding a new label for Presley. [3] Both Mercury Records and Columbia Records showed interest, although their initial offers were nowhere near the $40,000 requirement. [3] RCA Records , Hank Snow's current label, was also showing an interest, but they were put off by the cost of the contract.

There were many phases of construction and the church was renovated several times, before the final and most important period of building by Sir Christopher Wren from 1675-1710. St. Paul's Cathedral is currently being restored and continues to serve as an important place of worship for the city of London and as a sanctuary for those who visit it. [PAR] The land on which St. Paul's Cathedral now rests is believed to have been the site of earlier architectural structures (Whitaker-Wilson 65). Some historians believe that the first structure on this land was a temple to Diana built by the Romans. Historians also argue that this Roman temple was converted into a Christian church in A.D., 314 by the bishop of London at the time called Restitutus. Other historians, such as Bede, believed the first church was constructed by the King of Kent. He stated that the church was built for Mellitus who was consecrated as the bishop of London in A.D. 604 by St. Augustine. Mellitus was sent to England by Pope Gregory the Great and eventually went on to become the Archbishop of Canterbury. [PAR] It is believed that the Cathedral's name came from Mellitus who had a special devotion to St. Paul. He dedicated the Church to St. Paul instead of St. Peter, St. Peter, who was the more common patron for cathedrals at the time. Perhaps, the fact that Westminster Abbey had already been dedicated to St. Peter influenced the choice of St. Paul (Whitaker-Wilson 65-66). [PAR] At the end of the eleventh century, circa 1080, the city wanted to renovate the Church. Maurice was bishop of London at the time, and served under King Rufus. Authorities contemplated whether or not to elevate the Church into a cathedral. It is proposed that even William the Conqueror may have participated in the debate. It became a cathedral, however, the fire of 1087 destroyed the entire building (Whitaker-Wilson 66). It is believed that Bishop Maurice began the construction of a new building around 1088. Another fire broke out in 1136 near London Bridge and damaged the structure. Reparations were made, and rebuilding commenced, but the work went slow. [PAR] In 1444 during the reign of King Henry VI, the steeple of St. Paul's was set on fire by lightning and was not fixed until 1462 (Whitaker-Wilson 67). The next fire was in the year 1561 during the Elizabethan period. This fire was the result of a thunderstorm. The spire of the Cathedral was struck by lightning, and the steeple was burnt and fell (Whitaker-Wilson 67-68). After seeing that the steeple had burnt down twice in storms, the authorities decided not to rebuild it. [PAR] Efforts were not made to rebuild until the reign of King James I. The Cathedral was in such poor condition that James I was asked to visit the Church. After viewing it, the King sent for the architect Inigo Jones to survey the Cathedral (Whitaker-Wilson 68). James I knew that Jones preferred classical architecture but accepted him for the job because there were few surveyors (Whitaker-Wilson 68-69). Reconstruction of the Cathedral did not commence until 1633 (Whitaker-Wilson 69). [PAR] Jones was not well liked by the congregation of St. Paul's Cathedral because of his preference for an Italianate style. Jones was unpopular for taking down part of the church named \"St. Gregory-by-St.-Paul,\" a church that was connected to the Cathedral, to allow room for a classical portico for St. Paul's that he spent much time building. This was not an unusual situation because during Jones's tenure numerous obstacles constantly got in the way of the rebuilding. [PAR] During the Commonwealth, the portico was converted into a seamstress shop and shops for other trades. Later, Parliamentary soldiers transferred the nave of the Cathedral into barracks.

[PAR] He sings the song \" I Wanna Be Like You \" after he kidnaps Mowgli and asks the boy to show him the secret of \"man's red flower\" (the animal term for fire), so he and his followers can be like men. [PAR] Contents [PAR] [ show ] [PAR] Background [PAR] King Louie is a rowdy orangutan who was crowned King of the Apes. Unlike most characters in the film, Louie was created solely by the Walt Disney Company , and there was no ape king in the original novel by Rudyard Kipling , on which the film was based. The original story for Louie started out quite differently, but he was eventually given the voice and personality of the late and famed jazz trumpeter and vocalist Louis Prima . Milt Kahl , Frank Thomas and John Lounsbery animated the character. [PAR] Around 2001 , Louis Prima's widow sued the Walt Disney Company over the unauthorized use of her late husband's voice and public personal in past Jungle Book spin-off projects, as Jim Cummings 's imitations of Prima featured in them were near perfect. [1] In later years, Disney would continue to use Louie in theme park entities and other promotional material but refrained from having the character speak to avoid trouble with Mrs. Prima. [PAR] However, by 2010 , these files were apparently lifted, allowing Disney to once again have full use of the character, as evidenced by 2012 's debut of the live show Wishes , aboard the Disney Fantasy cruise ship, marking Louie's first speaking role (with newly recorded dialogue) since the 2000 video game The Jungle Book Groove Party . [PAR] Personality [PAR] As King of the Apes, Louie enjoys a lavished life in his palace among the ancient ruins of India, apparently living by his own law and order. Waited on by his monkey minions, Louie enjoys jazzy music, fun-filled parties, and a seemingly endless supply of bananas and other fruits. With a laid-back, fun-loving nature, similar to that of Baloo , Louie appears as a generally jovial member of the jungle, though his scheme to learn the ways of \"man's red flower\" is seen as scandalous; Bagheera referring to the ape as a scoundrel upon learning the motives behind his hopes of becoming a human. [PAR] Alternatively, it's possible that Louie simply desires more power; as while he claims to merely want to be a human, he expresses a very specific interest. Namely in \"Man's Red Flower\" - fire, is frequently alluded upon in the story as being something all animals fear. Louie takes advantage of Mowgli's naivety to attempt to convince him to learn how to make fire; should Louie get this knowledge, he could quite easily hold the entire jungle hostage and rule over it through fear, making sense of Bagheera's disgust over the matter. This theory is supported by Louie's verses during his musical number: \"I've reached the top and had to stop, and that's what's bothering me!\"; this indicates that his desire to be human stems from wanting more out of life, after having reached the highest point of success in the jungle\u2014becoming king of the apes. [PAR] Nevertheless, Louie seems too lighthearted to cause any legitimate harm. After kidnapping Mowgli, both the man-cub and the King of the apes come to enjoy one another's company, to the point where Louie's fun-filled method of persuasion (a jazzy party with his monkeys) ultimately distracted from his quest to learn the ways of fire until Baloo and Bageheera arrived onto the scene. [PAR] In subsequent media appearances, such as More Jungle Book... Further Adventures of Baloo and Mowgli , Louie appears to have made amends with Baloo and Bagheera, regarding the incident with Mowgli, and even aided Bagheera in helping Baloo overcome his longing to reunite with the man-cub, after the latter returned to the Man Village.

[PAR] by bloggle [PAR] As we prepare for our first Firkin Crawl (say that 3 times fast), it occurred to us a little background info might be in order . . . i.e., what the firk\u2019s a firkin? [PAR] First of all, it\u2019s just a fun word to say. Kinda like \u2018arugula\u2019. (you just said that out loud didn\u2019t you?) The name derives from a Dutch word, vierdekijn (VEERD-kin), which means \u2018fourth\u2019. It\u2019s an Old English unit of measurement, and amounts to about a quarter (fourth) of a full barrel. How much is a quarter barrel? Well obviously that depends a lot on the size of the barrel. [PAR] \"can I interest you in a bit of firkin?\" [PAR] The English have been using the firkin as a measurement for all kinds of things for hundreds of years. British records dating back to the early 1400\u2019s list statutes for how much a firkin actually holds. The product being weighed or measured dictated the barrel size, and thus, the firkin size. In other words, firkins are fickle. A firkin of fish was 21 gallons; a firkin of soap, honey, or butter was around 8 gallons. (sadly, our research turned up no information on the size of a firkin of gherkins.) And, proving that the Brits have always been pretty serious about their suds, they had separate firkin measurements for beer and ale: a beer firkin was 9 gallons, an ale firkin 8 gallons. And those are imperial gallons, slightly larger than U.S. gallons (insert your own buxom British girls joke here). [PAR] Firkin of soap. Not nearly as tasty. [PAR] It really gets fun when you start looking at other forms of measurement from that era. A firkin was the smallest unit of liquid measurement where the barrel was concerned. It took 2 firkins to make a kilderkin, 4 to make a barrel, and 6 to make a hogshead. I can just see being in line at the beer store back then. \u201cCan I get a couple of firkins to fill up my hogshead?\u201d It just sounds dirty. [PAR] OK but where does the tap go? [PAR] Today\u2019s craft beer firkins are 9 imperial gallons, 10.8 U.S. gallons. In brew-speak, about 72 pints of beer. Craft breweries like firkins for several reasons (outside of the fact everyone snickers every time someone says \u2018firkin\u2019); they allow for experimentation with existing beers, are naturally carbonated from being sealed in the firkin prior to the completion of fermentation, and are not pasteurized. That not only guarantees freshness when consumed, but allows for some interesting and subtle flavor changes since the brew\u2019s yeast is still active. [PAR] So don\u2019t be a kilderkin. Get your firkin hoghead\u00a0over to the pub and sample a barrel of cask-conditioned beer. And let us know what you think.

[PAR] The game originated hundreds of years ago, when the only playthings boys and girls had were materials they found near their homes. They collected small stones and animal bones and learned to use them in a game. They tossed them into the air in a way similar to today's version of the game . An older version of the game used five stone cubes made of clay, wood, ivory, bone, plastic, or other substances.  This game is usually played with two people [PAR] Pieces [PAR] Traditionally, jacks are metal objects bearing six tips at right angles to one another, four of which are usually rounded, with two opposite tips more pointed. This ensures the jack is relatively easy to pick up. Also required is a small rubber ball, used as a sort of timing device: the jacks are manipulated in the time it takes the ball to bounce up in the air and return to te height of the hand that catches it. [PAR] Play [PAR] The players decide who goes first, usually through \"flipping\" (when the set of jacks is placed in cupped hands, flipped to the back of the hands, and then back to cupped hands again; the player who keeps the most from falling in his/her turn, goes first); or perhaps via ip dip, (or Eeny, meeny, miny, moe),  or a variant.  Then the jacks are scattered loosely into the play area.  The players take it in turn to bounce the ball off the ground, then pick up jacks, and then catch the ball before it bounces for a second time. The number of jacks to be picked up is pre-ordained and sequential: at first you must pick up one (\"onesies\"), next two (\"twosies\"), and so on.  Depending on the total number of jacks included, the number may not divide evenly and there may be jacks left over.  If the player chooses to pick up the leftover jacks first, one variation is to announce this by saying \"horse before carriage\" or \"queens before kings.\" The playing area can vary but there is no official game [PAR] Winning [PAR] The winning player is the one to pick up the largest number of jacks.  If playing with fifteen, that goal is rarely, if ever, achieved.   If ten jacks are used, the person who gets to the highest game wins.  Game 1 is usually single bounce (onesies through tensies); game 2 is chosen by whoever \"graduates\" to game 2 first, and so on.  Some game variations are \"double bounces,\" \"pigs in the pen,\" \"over the fence,\" \"eggs in the basket\" (or \"cherries in the basket,\") \"flying Dutchman,\" \"around the world,\" etc.   Some games, such as \"Jack be nimble,\" are short games which are not played in the onesies to tensies format. [PAR] Variations [PAR] A variation of this game known as \"gobs\" was played in Cork, Ireland in the 1950s using five pebbles (often quartz) found on the beach. [PAR] Another variation played by Orthodox Jewish school-age boys is known as \"kugelach.\" Instead of jacks and a rubber ball, five dice-sized metal cubes are used.  The game cube is tossed in the air rather than bounced. This is also known by Orthodox Jewish school-age children as \"chamesh avanim\", or \"five rocks\". [PAR] A very similar variation called \"best tas\", or \"five rocks\" again, is played by children in Turkey with five pebbles, where one is tossed into the air and the player tries to pick up those on the ground one by one, two by two, etc., before catching the pebble in the air. [PAR] In modern day Korea a form of jacks called gonggi is played by children.

It was partly based on his experiences  with the 112th Cavalry Regiment during the Philippines Campaign in World War II.  It was later adapted into a film of the same name in 1958. [PAR] In 1998 the Modern Library ranked The Naked and the Dead 51st on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. [PAR] Plot [PAR] The novel is divided into four Parts: Wave, Argil and Mold, Plant and Phantom, and Wake. Within these parts are Chorus sections, consisting of play-like dialogue between characters, as well as Time Machine sections, which give brief histories and flashbacks of individual characters\u2019 lives. [PAR] The story takes place on Anopopei, a fictional island somewhere in the South Pacific. American forces are faced with a campaign to drive out the Japanese so that Americans can advance into the Philippines. The novel itself focuses on the experiences of one platoon, overseen by Lieutenant Hearn and General Cummings.  Although Mailer does not write about the significance or details of the campaign, it is implied that this platoon, like all platoons in the Army, is simply just obeying orders, uncertain what those orders might be. [PAR] ;Part One, Wave [PAR] Characters are introduced as they wait around for orders. A naval bombardment soon takes place. The men take their places on a boat where they are driven to the shore of a beach. Here they fire back and forth at the Japanese. Hennessey becomes so frightened that he soils in his pants. Unthinking, he runs out of his foxhole and is shot to death. Part One concludes with this death, which alarms many of the men, since for many soldiers Hennessey\u2019s death is the first comrade death they witness. [PAR] ;Part Two, Argil and Mold [PAR] The campaign continues and replacements arrive. General Cummings and Hearn have many discussions. It is evident that Cummings has homosexual feelings towards Hearn, although he refuses to admit them to even himself. Much later in Part Two, Cummings transfers Hearn to Dalleson\u2019s section where he directly leads the platoon. At one point, the platoon takes one Japanese soldier as prisoner. When Gallagher gives the Japanese soldier a cigarette to smoke, the soldier closes his eyes in relaxation. At this moment, Croft shoots and kills him, demonstrating Croft\u2019s coldblooded personality. Later in Part Two, Gallagher receives word that his wife, Mary, died in childbirth. Although Gallagher\u2019s child survived, he is overcome by immense grief throughout the rest of the novel. [PAR] ;Part Three, Plant and Phantom [PAR] Many men die and others are sent home. Hearn is assigned to lead the platoon through the jungle and up Mountain Anaka. After an ambush, Wilson is shot and forgotten by the platoon. After realizing that Wilson was left behind, Croft sends men back to get Wilson. Brown, Stanley, Goldstein, and Ridges then carry Wilson back to the beach on a stretcher. The trip takes several days, and Wilson ends up dying. The men eventually lose Wilson\u2019s body in a river. After Wilson is shot, Hearn is also killed anticlimactically, leaving Croft in charge. The men continue hiking up the mountain due to Croft\u2019s orders, even though many men view it as a hopeless cause. Later, Roth dies while attempting to make a jump on the mountain\u2019s edge. Trudging on, the men eventually give up their task in climbing the mountain. They return to the beach where Brown, Stanley, Goldstein, and Ridges have arrived from their mission with Wilson. Surprisingly, the ruthless Croft is relieved that he was unable to climb the mountain. At the end of Part Three, the remaining men discuss their future and how it will feel when they return home now that their mission is over. [PAR] ;Part Four, Wake [PAR] This part consists of one short chapter. Cummings reflects on the war and Dalleson\u2019s victory.

Mankowitz was born and raised in London's East End. He studied English at Cambridge, then, like his father, became an antique dealer, revealing his expertise in Wedgwood (1953), The Portland Vase (1952), and A Concise Encyclopedia of English Pottery and Porcelain (1957) with R.G. Haggar. He turned increasingly to literature and wrote a number of books inspired by his childhood recollections of the East End. These include A Kid for Two Farthings (1953), the title of which was suggested by the Passover allegorical ditty *\u1e24ad Gadya; Make Me An Offer (1952); The Boychick (1954); and The Mendelman Fire (1957). In his early writing, Mankowitz's Jewishness was somewhat muted, revealing itself merely in a preference for Jewish characters. His typical mingling of humor and pathos comes out strongly in the play, The Bespoke Overcoat (1955), a Jewish reworking of a Russian tale by Gogol. Like several of his other stories, this was made into a motion picture. Mankowitz was primarily a humorist with a talent for elaborating anecdotes, but he gradually developed a more astringent tone in his writing, e.g., Expresso Bongo (1960), a satire on the world of \"pop\" music, and in his satirical novel about film-makers, Cockatrice (1963). He later devoted himself to screen-writing and to publicity work in support of the \u1e24asidic sect of Lubavitch. Mankowitz was the author or coauthor of a number of well-known screenplays, including The Day the Earth Caught Fire (1961), Casino Royale (1967), and The Hireling (1973).

He was 73. [PAR] When he retired from writing books in 1991, he disclosed that he had terminal cancer. [PAR] Although he wrote fiction and nonfiction, created original screenplays and adaptations, and became an authority on porcelain, Mr. Mankowitz's best and earliest work, including the novels A Kid for Two Farthings and Make Me an Offer, captured the culture, humor and linguistic vibrancy of the heavily Jewish East End, the neighborhood into which he was born in 1924 and named Cyril Wolf Mankowitz. [PAR] He was the son of a Russian emigrant, Solomon Mankowitz, who sold antiques and secondhand books in an open-air East End market and who imbued his son with a love of both. When Wolf won a scholarship to Cambridge, his father sold all his stock, raising about $150 so that he would have the money to go. [PAR] Although he would go on to set up his own antiques business, later opening a highly successful porcelain shop in Piccadilly _ ``There is something spiritual in search of material to sell,'' he once said _ Mr. Mankowitz was determined to make his living from writing. After graduating from Cambridge, where he studied English under F.R. Leavis, edited a literary magazine and made ends meet by working in a bookshop, he began to write in earnest, winning an award from the Society of Authors for his poetry.

Arthur turns out to be Arthur (later Sir Arthur) Conan Doyle, famous these days chiefly as the creator of Sherlock Holmes but famous during his lifetime for many other books as well. [PAR] George is also a historical figure, though one rather less well known. He's George Edalji (pronounced \"Aydlji\" as he has occasion to say more than a few times in the novel). George was the son of a vicar in the British Midlands. His father was born in India and his mother was born in Scotland. George did well in school and became a solicitor in Birmingham. George and Arthur's paths crossed in 1906 (when George was 30 and Arthur 47) and Arthur had occasion to do some real-life detective work. [PAR] The book does an excellent job on atmosphere. That's partly a result of Mr Barnes's patient accumulation of details in the narrative. Indeed, the novel proceeds at a pace more common for novels of the time it's set in than of recent novels. [PAR] The narrator follows George and Arthur by turns, in sections headed with the character's name. The first \"George\" section begins, \"George does not have a first memory, and by the time anyone suggests that it might be normal to have one, it is too late\" (p. 4). The book begins with both characters as very young boys and ends with Sir Arthur's sort-of funeral. Indeed, Arthur's and George's paths don't cross until around the middle of the book. If you have the patience for a book that deals with such a broad scope in a comprehensive and unhurried way, your patience will be rewarded: the characters are finely-drawn and their story is an interesting one. [PAR] As of this writing, Mr Barnes's Wikipedia article emphasizes the postmodern and French influences in his work. I don't detect those influences to any significant degree in this book. Unless you count the fact that the narrative often addresses issues of perception, but plenty of books do that. [PAR] Indeed, Mr Barnes rather hits the reader over the head with issues of perception near the end of the book, which slightly spoils the effect in my opinion, but that's a small thing.

[PAR] Arthur and George grow up worlds and miles apart in late 19th century Britain: Arthur in shabby-genteel Catholic Edinburgh, George in the vicarage of a small Staffordshire village. Arthur is to become one of the most famous men of his age, George a Birmingham solicitor, is happy in hardworking obscurity. But as the new century begins, they are brought together by a sequence of events that made sensational headlines at the time as The Great Wyrley Outrages. [PAR] With a mixture of intense research and vivid imagination, Julian Barnes brings into sharp focus not just this long-forgotten case but the inner workings of the two men and the wider psychology of the age. Arthur & George is a novel in which the events of a hundred years ago constantly set off contemporary echoes. It is a novel about low crime and high spirituality; guilt and innocence; identity, nationality and race; and thwarted passion.

These classifications come in threes, just like the sides and angles themselves. That is, a triangle has three sides, and three terms describe triangles based on their sides; a triangle also has three angles, and three classifications of triangles are based on their angles. The following are triangle classifications based on sides: [PAR] Scalene triangle: A triangle with no congruent sides [PAR] Isosceles triangle: A triangle with at least two congruent sides [PAR] Equilateral triangle: A triangle with three congruent sides [PAR] Because an equilateral triangle is also isosceles, all triangles are either scalene or isosceles. But when people call a triangle isosceles, they\u2019re usually referring to a triangle with only two equal sides, because if the triangle had three equal sides, they\u2019d call it equilateral. However, you can\u2019t always assume this when you\u2019re doing tricky geometry homework. [PAR] Scalene triangles [PAR] In addition to having three unequal sides, scalene triangles have three unequal angles. The shortest side is across from the smallest angle, the middle-length side is across from the mid-sized angle, and \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 the longest side is across from the largest angle. [PAR] The ratio of sides doesn\u2019t equal the ratio of angles. Don\u2019t assume that if one side of a triangle is, say, twice as long as another side that the angles opposite those sides are also in a 2:1 ratio. The ratio of the sides may be close to the ratio of the angles, but, for a scalene triangle, these ratios are never exactly equal. [PAR] Isosceles triangles [PAR] An isosceles triangle has two equal sides and two equal angles. The equal sides are called legs, and the third side is the base. The two angles touching the base (which are congruent, or equal) are called base angles. The angle between the two legs is called the vertex angle. [PAR] Equilateral triangles [PAR] An equilateral triangle has three equal sides and three equal angles (which are each 60\u00b0). Its equal angles make it equiangular as well as equilateral. You don\u2019t often hear the expression equiangular triangle, however, because the only triangle that\u2019s equiangular is the equilateral triangle, and everyone calls this triangle equilateral. (With quadrilaterals and other polygons, however, you need both terms, because an equiangular figure, such as a rectangle, can have sides of different lengths, and an equilateral figure, such as a rhombus, can have angles of different sizes.) [PAR] If you cut an equilateral triangle in half right down the middle, you get two 30\u00b0- 60\u00b0- 90\u00b0 right triangles, which figure very heavily in geometry and trigonometry work.[DOC] [TLE] Geometry - NDT edGeometry [PAR] Home - Education Resources [PAR] Geometry [PAR] Geometry is the branch of mathematics that that deals with points, lines, planes, and solid bodies and examines their properties, measurements\n\n\n### Answer:\nscalene </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] Astrakhan has a distinctive tight, whorled, loopy surface with a slight sheen. \u00a0The younger the lamb, the tighter and shinier the loops. \u00a0True astrakhan comes in a range of colours from pale golden yellow to black, though black is the most desirable. [PAR] Evening Cape of silk ruched to imitate astrakhan, Lanvin, Jeanne, Winter 1935 V&A [PAR] This may be the part where you are thinking \u201cfetal or\u2026wait, what!?!\u201d. [PAR] Yes, the most desirable form of astrakhan is that from a lamb 15-30 days away from being born , and it is sourced by killing both the ewe and the unborn lamb. \u00a0Horrific. [PAR] There are other ways to source astrakhan: either by waiting for the lamb to be born, or by utilizing the pelts of lambs that are born dead (beware that some companies selling lamb-ewe fetal kill astrakhan describe it as \u2018stillborn\u2019 \u2013 a euphemism if I ever heard one!), or die shortly after birth in adverse weather conditions. [PAR] The last two options, stillborn lambs and ones that died within their first few days, are probably how astrakhan first became used: peasants sought to wring any value that they could from a dead animal. [PAR] It\u2019s no surprise that there were enough lamb mortalities to start a fashion for the pelts of Karkul sheep. \u00a0 The sheep are from the high mountainous regions in Central Asia, an area with very severe and unpredictable weather which would easily contribute to a high lamb die-off. [PAR] Astrakhan (the Russian name) is also known as broadtail, Persian lamb, Karkul lamb, karakulcha,\u00a0\u00a0krimmer (another Russian term), agnello di Persia (an Italian term also used by posh fashion magazines trying to be..well\u2026posh),\u00a0breitschwanz (German, used by somewhat less posh fashion magazines),\u00a0garak\u00f6li bagana (in Central Asia), slink \u00a0or slinky (usually used for generic newborn lamb fleece, not that of the Karakul sheep), and finally, swakara (for \u2018South West African Karakul\u2019) \u00a0if it comes from Namibia, where a population of the sheep was introduced in the early 20th century. \u00a0There is no standard as to whether most of the names should be capitalized or not. [PAR] The name used for astrakhan can differentiate between how the fur is sourced (newborn vs. fetal), but there is no international standard for most of the usages, so the name is usually not a guarantee of the type of fur you are getting. \u00a0The\u00a0 U.S. Fur Products Labeling Act (16 C.F.R. Part 301) \u00a0for example, designates broadtail as specifically fetal, while a New Zealand company emphasizes that its broadtail is exclusively from natural lamb casualties. [PAR] The use of astrakhan dates back centuries in Central Asia and the Middle East, where it was used in traditional garments and gave its name to the Karkul hat .

Within NATO, each member nation's corresponding military rank of corporal is combined under the NATO-standard rank scale code OR-4. [PAR] The rank of corporal nominally corresponds to commanding a section or squad of soldiers. However, in the United States Army, the rank of corporal is rarely used as most with the rank of E-4 are specialist and can do the same job that a corporal does. As the Table of Organization & Equipment (TO&E) rank of a fire team leader is sergeant and that of squad leader is staff sergeant. In the United States Marine Corps, corporal is the Table of Organization (TO) rank for a rifle fire team leader, machine gun team leader, light mortar squad leader, and assault weapon squad leader, as well as gunner on most larger crew served weapons (i.e., medium mortars, heavy machine guns, anti-tank missiles), armored vehicles (e.g., tanks, light armored vehicles, and armored assault vehicles), and the two assistant gunners on a howitzer (the gunner is a sergeant). [PAR] In most countries which derive their military structure from the British military system, it is a more senior rank than that of private. However, in several other countries, such as Canada, Italy and Norway, corporal is a junior rank, indicating a more experienced soldier than a private, and also on a higher pay scale, but having no particular command appointment corresponding to the rank, similar to specialist in the U.S. Army. [PAR] Etymology  [PAR] The word is derived from the medieval Italian phrase capo corporale (\"head of a body\").  It may also be derived from an appointment as an officer's bodyguard, originally being an adjective pertaining to the word \"body\". [PAR] Argentina  [PAR] All three branches of the Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic use two or three ranks of corporal, or cabo. Corporals in the Argentine military are considered suboficiales subalternos (subaltern sub-officers/lower non-commissioned officers), superior only to all ranks of Volunteers (enlisted members of the Army and Air Force) and Seamen (enlisted members of the Navy). [PAR] In the Argentine Army, there are two ranks of corporal, junior and senior: Cabo (\u201ccorporal\u201d) and cabo primero (\u201cfirst corporal\u201d). [PAR] While the Argentine Navy has three corporal ranks, from junior to senior: Cabo segundo (corporal second class), Cabo primero (corporal first class) and cabo principal (principal corporal), which is equal to the army rank of sargento (sergeant). The Air Force has the same number of corporal ranks as the navy, and keeps the same titles, with the exception of cabo (corporal) instead of the navy's cabo segundo (corporal second class). [PAR] The rank is also used by the Argentine National Gendarmerie and the Argentine Federal Police, which use the rank in the same manner as the Army, as well as the Argentine Naval Prefecture. [PAR] Australia  [PAR] Corporal is the second lowest of the non-commissioned officer ranks in the Australian Army, falling between lance-corporal and sergeant. A corporal is usually a section commander,  and is in charge of 7-14 soldiers of private rank. He is assisted by a second-in-command, a lance-corporal or a senior private. The same ranks within artillery units are bombardier and lance-bombardier respectively. A corporal is frequently referred to as 'seco' (abbreviation of section commander) by all ranks in everyday speech but not in formal written correspondence. [PAR] Corporal is also a rank of the Royal Australian Air Force, being equal to both the Australian Army and Royal Air Force rank of corporal. There is no RAAF equivalent to the army rank of lance-corporal. [PAR] Belgium  [PAR] All branches of the Belgian Armed Forces, except the Naval Component, use three ranks of corporal: corporal (, ), master corporal (, ) and 1st master corporal (, ).

[PAR] Rising to prominence due to a heavily hyped exhibition and a Banksy-directed documentary entitled, \u201cExit Through the Gift Shop,\u201d the French artist Mr. Brainwash was once a clothing store owner named Thierry Guetta. He came to the United States with his family years before he would become one of contemporary art\u2019s largest and most confusing personalities. [PAR] In his early years, Guetta was a successful businessman who recognized the power of promotion. [PAR] \u201cWhen the sewing [on a shirt] was different, I\u2019d call it \u2018designer\u2019 and charge $400,\u201d said Guetta in \u201cExit Through the Giftshop.\u201d [PAR] Guetta was haunted by the death of his mother since he was a young child, and as a way of preserving family and friends, he picked up a video camera. During his life in the United States, Guetta filmed absolutely everything. He had several cameras set up inside his house to document his family\u2019s life and always carried his personal camcorder with him, logging thousands of hours of eventless footage that he kept in large plastic tubs. [PAR] On a visit to France, Guetta filmed his cousin, the street artist Space Invader . The experience changed Guetta\u2019s life. He was drawn to the immediacy, impermanence and the danger of street art, and as he watched Invader install video game mosaics in Paris, he became fascinated with the role of street art in modern culture. [PAR] \u201c[The artists] really believed it, really loved it,\u201d [PAR] Guetta said later. \u201cI started to really see a gallery outside.\u201d [PAR] After returning to the United States, Thierry spent 10 months following Shepard Fairey, the legendary creator of the Andre the Giant OBEY street piece. [PAR] Fairey showed Guetta how to choose walls and how to avoid police detection, skills that Guetta would put to good use over the next several years. Guetta soon realized that he could create a street art documentary from his hundreds of hours of footage. [PAR] He had a new purpose and life. Thierry stepped up his filming, meeting one street artist after another and logging a tremendous amount of footage, most of which sat in unmarked boxes in his Los Angeles home. He documented the creation of pieces by Buffmonsters, Borf, Swoon, Dotmasters, and eventually, Banksy. [PAR] Thierry Guetta and Banksy [PAR] The secretive Banksy was gaining recognition and infamy as an \u201cart terrorist,\u201d and Guetta was intrigued. However, despite his numerous connections in the international street art community, Guetta had no way to contact the legendary Englishman. [PAR] As it turns out, is was Banksy who needed Guetta. During a visit to Los Angeles, Banksy\u2019s area contact was detained by federal immigration enforcers. Banksy contacted Guetta through Shepard Fairey for help. [PAR] The chance meeting became the genesis of Guetta\u2019s career. Banksy took Guetta under his wing, allowing him to film everything he did and involving Guetta in many of his works. Guetta helped Banksy pull off a stunt at Disneyland that recalled Guantanamo Bay, and he was there filming Banksy\u2019s famous painted elephant at a Los Angeles art show, asking viewers about the piece. Thierry had become one of Banksy\u2019s closest friends and confidants.

It is highly reflective, and its way of moving at the slightest touch give it a quality of almost being alive.  In a previous age, the word \"quick\", was used to refer to things that were alive, not just things that were \"fast\".  (This is why we still hear references to \"the quick and the dead\".) [PAR] Mercury is the only metal that, at room temperature, remains a liquid.  It does not become a solid until it gets down to -38.72 degrees centigrade .  This means that it can be frozen with dry ice.  Yet it is still a brittle metal, even in its solid state.  This is because Mercury does not like to bond with itself, and is highly resistant to bonding with other elements.  Mercury will form a gas at 357 degrees centigrade.  In its vaporous state it makes very good light when heated with an electrical charge.  Mercury vapor lighting is common in street lights and hallways. [PAR] Number 80 on the periodic chart, Mercury is right next to gold.  Alchemists of a previous age commonly associated quicksilver with that precious metal.  The easiest way to get pure mercury is to extract it from the mineral, cinnabar.  Alchemists would heat up a piece of cinnabar (mercury sulfide) and the mercury would seem to simply ooze from the rock.  A demonstration of this process to patrons could help convince them that gold might indeed be manufactured from a bar of lead! [PAR] A fairly dense metal, mercury is 13.6 times heavier than water.  Its density means that heavy objects, which are less dense, can easily float on top of it.  For example a brick or a billiard ball that would plunge to the bottom of a container of water will skim about lightly on a container of mercury.  Mercury in its pure state is seldom found just lying about.   Like water it \"evaporates\" (though more slowly).  In the air it is much more dangerous than in its liquid state. [PAR] The chemical symbol for mercury is \"Hg\".  This is derived for the Latin name hydrargyrum or \"water silver\".  It is not magnetic at all, which means that a spill cannot be cleaned up with a magnet.  Mercury is used in vermillion paint pigment, lighting, batteries and some limited medicines.  Yet mercury does have a serious downside.  It is a poison.[DOC] [TLE] Quicksilver | Define Quicksilver at Dictionary.comQuicksilver |\n\n\n### Answer:\nmercury </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

They were one of the most successful bands of the 1980s and a leading band in the MTV-driven \"Second British Invasion\" of the United States. Since the 1980s, they have placed 14 singles in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart and 21 in the Billboard Hot 100 and have, according to the Sunday Mercury, sold more than 100 million records. [PAR] When MTV dawned in the early 1980s, it changed the face of popular music forever, and the British rock group Duran Duran was the first act to take full advantage of its possibilities. The five-member band of young, sculpted faces often adorned with make-up and expensive clothes, saw in the music video the perfect vehicle for propelling them beyond obscurity and their musical abilities to fame, fortune, and good times. Combining the sounds of 1970s British punk and the more upbeat, danceable rhythms of disco, Duran Duran began producing clean, sparkling (if not critically acclaimed), pop tunes. But what set them apart immediately were their videos: somewhat surreal escapist fantasies that took the self-styled playboys to such far-flung locales as Sri Lanka and Antigua. Screaming, record-buying, television-watching teen-age girls everywhere ate it up-and nobody could have predicted it better than the band members themselves. \"Video to us is like stereo was to Pink Floyd,\" said Duran Duran keyboa rdist Nick Rhodes. \"It was new, it was just happening. And we saw we could do a lot with it.\" But, with more than 25 years together and more than 70 million albums sold, the group has proven its significance well beyond the video screen. [PAR] While the conservative rock press liked to downplay the success of Duran Duran because of their obvious vanity and lack of attention to \"serious\" music, it should be noted that some of rock and roll's most time-honored heroes, such as Elvis Presley and even a few members of the Beatles, were never accused of being serious musicians. Success in pop music has always depended upon image at least as much as the music itself. And \"serious music\" is not necessarily for everyone as Rolling Stone's James Henke realized when he referred to Duran Duran's eager fans as \"young girls who were glued to their television sets watching MTV every waking hour. These girls had little use for the Clash's left-wing politics, or the ranting and raving of that weird-looking Elvis Costello. But Duran Duran, now they were something else. Five extremely good-looking young men. Dream dates.\" [PAR] Duran Duran began coming together in 1978 (some sources say 1977) in the Midlands city of Birmingham, where Rhodes and guitarist John Taylor started performing with a variety of bandmates. The group, which takes its name from a character in the 1968 film Barbarella, became complete in 1980 when Simon Le Bon, a drop-out drama student, showed up one day in pink, leopard-skin leotards and said he wanted to sing in the band. Le Bon joined Rhodes, John Taylor (who switched to b ass), drummer Roger Taylor, and guitarist Andy Taylor (none of the Taylors are related), and the quintet began performing in Birmingham, most frequently at a club called Rum Runners which had become established as the home of England's burgeoning New Roma ntic scene. \"Donning the foppish clothes of the movement and playing a slick, if superficial, brand of dance-pop, the band was tailor-made for the style obsessed New Romantics,\" said the Encyclopedia of Rock. [PAR] Duran Duran quickly became the headliners of that movement, playing at large clubs and festivals throughout England, and in early 1981 they released their first single, \"Planet Earth,\" which went to number 12 on the United Kingdom charts. Later that year their first album, Duran Duran, went to number three on the album charts and\n\n\n### Answer:\nbarbarella </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Take the case of Salvatore \"Sonny\" Bono, who drove a meat delivery truck along Hollywood's Sunset Blvd. in the late 1950s and eventually became a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Or Cherilyn Sarkisian, a teenager who grew up some 200 miles from there in El Centro and later hung around Santa Monica Blvd. in Hollywood, hoping for a break as an actress. She eventually became a fashion icon and won an Academy Award. Sometime in between the two met, married and became singing stars...and household names. [PAR] There were some who saw Sonny and Cher as quite the odd couple when they exploded onto the music scene in 1965. Their image, in fact, purposely cast them as outsiders marching to a different beat. Their union was not a lifelong one, at least not on the outside for all to see, but it may very well be they were more right for each other than any two people could ever be. Sonny had started out eight years earlier, trying to convince the record labels along his delivery route that he could write songs, but none were particularly receptive until Art Rupe at Specialty Records gave him a shot. A bit of madness called \"You Bug Me, Baby,\" cowritten with Larry Willams, was a mid-chart hit for Williams in December 1957 and marked Sonny's first success as a writer. Using the pseudonym Don Christy (after his first wife Donna and daughter Christy), he and Roddy Jackson penned \"She Said Yeah\" for Williams; the song gained greater notoriety several years later when The Rolling Stones remade it for the album December's Children (And Everybody's). [PAR] Rupe made Sonny an A&R man for Specialty and he worked with the label's new talent including Don and Dewey; under the Christy name he wrote one of their better-known efforts, \"Koko Joe.\" Later, seeking to establish himself as a singer, he released one single in '59 as Don Christy on Specialty and a few for other labels over the next year or so. He used his own name for a one-shot single on the Highland label around the time he began working with Jack Nitzsche; the two composed \"Needles and Pins,\" a minor '63 hit for Jackie DeShannon (and bigger smash for The Searchers the following year). Jack and Sonny both went to work for Phil Spector after that; in Sonny's case he was basically doing whatever Phil told him to during the 1962 and '63 sessions at Gold Star Studios that marked the peak of Spector's producing career. Sonny admitted he was \"Phil's flunky\" while he assisted with everything - producing, arranging, engineering, singing background and playing percussion, even running errands and bringing Spector coffee when he wanted it. [PAR] When 16-year-old Cherilyn LaPiere (using her stepfather's surname) started coming around she quickly caught Sonny's eye (and Phil's and all the other men in the vicinity). Spector let her do some backup singing on a few sessions, and she can be heard behind The Crystals and The Ronettes on some of their 1963 recordings. Spector decided to record her solo on a quickie called \"Ringo, I Love You,\" written by Phil with Paul Case, Vini Poncia and Peter Andreoli. Released in early 1964, just after The Beatles had broken wide open in the U.S., she was credited on the single as Bonnie Jo Mason (a name Spector made up) and released on Annette Records (as opposed to his usual Philles label). While a few Beatles-related novelty singles hit the charts in '64, this wasn't one of them.

These parts usually include ears, eyes, shoes, a hat, a nose, and a mouth. The toy was invented and developed by George Lerner in 1949, and first manufactured and distributed by Hasbro in 1952.[1] Mr. Potato Head was the first toy advertised on television[2][3] and has remained in production since its debut. The toy was originally produced as separate plastic parts with pushpins that could be stuck into a real potato or other vegetable. However, due to complaints regarding rotting vegetables and new government safety regulations, Hasbro began including a plastic potato body within the toy set.[4] [PAR] Over the years, the original toy was joined by Mrs. Potato Head and supplemented with accessories such as a car and a boat trailer. Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head may be best known for their appearances in the Toy Story franchise. Additionally, in 1998 The Mr. Potato Head Show aired, but was short lived with only one season being produced.[5] As one of the prominent marks of Hasbro, a Mr. Potato Head balloon has also joined others in the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.[6] Today, Mr. Potato Head can still be seen adorning hats, shirts, and ties. Toy Story Midway Mania at California Adventure Park in Disneyland California also features a large talking Mr. Potato Head. [PAR] Mr. Potato Head's popularity has led him to some appearances in films and television. In 1985, Mr Potato Head played a supporting role in Potato Head Kids, his first dramatic television appearance. In 1995, Mr. Potato Head appeared in the Disney/Pixar film Toy Story, voiced by Don Rickles. He returned between 1999 and 2010 in Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3 alongside Mrs. Potato Head. In 1998-99, he had his own short-lived Fox Kids series, The Mr. Potato Head Show. In addition to film and television, the character has been the subject of a comic strip created by Jim Davis. Cartoonist Gary Larson included the character in several of his The Far Side cartoons. In commercial for Bridgestone tires during Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, Mr. Potato Head is driving a car and Mrs. Potato Head is nagging him. [PAR] Mr Potato Head has also acted as spokesman for several causes. In 1987, Mr Potato Head surrendered his pipe to become the spokesperson for the American Cancer Society's annual \"Great American Smokeout\" campaign. He performed the role for several years. In 1992, he received a special award from the President's Council for Physical Fitness. In 1996, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head joined the League of Women Voters and their \"Get Out to Vote\" campaign. Mr. Potato Head is also the inspiration/main character of an upcoming fan film, Potato Headed. [PAR] The famous toy has made other appearances. In 1997 Burger King brought him aboard for the introduction of their new French fry and their \"Try the Fry\" campaign. In Britain, Walkers crisps has a line of crisps called Potato Heads, featuring a Potato Head rendition of Gary Lineker on the packet.[16] An interactive Audio-Animatronic version appears in the queue for the Toy Story Midway Mania! attractions at Disney's Hollywood Studios and Disney California Adventure Park.

The Music Man found Robert Preston re-creating his starring role as conman Professor Harold Hill, intent on swindling the good people of River City, IA, by selling them on a fictitious boys' band, and some minor roles were also filled by the Broadway originals. More important, Meredith Willson 's score was rendered intact, the only change being a revision of the song \"My White Knight\" into \"Being in Love.\" The major casting change was the substitution of Shirley Jones, who had a box-office track record, for Barbara Cook , who did not, in the role of Marian the librarian. Cook may have been preferable, but Jones handled the part well, too. Musically, the big change had to do with scale; the Broadway pit orchestra and original cast were replaced by a vast Hollywood orchestra and chorus, and musical director Ray Heindorf made the most of the larger effects on songs like \"Seventy Six Trombones.\" Still, the music fan who already owned a copy of the original Broadway cast recording didn't really need to plump for the original motion picture soundtrack, which didn't keep the album from racing up the charts and going gold as the film became one of the year's top grossers. But it remains true; unless you are a Shirley Jones fan or want to hear future Andy Griffith Show co-star and film director Ronnie Howard sing \"Gary, Indiana\" with a lisp, stick to the Broadway version.

The first blood transfusions were also attempted around this time, although these were often unsuccessful and proved fatal in humans. [PAR] The first successful blood transfusion recorded was performed by British physician Richard Lower in 1665 when he bled a dog almost to death and then revived the animal by transfusing blood from another dog via a tied artery. [PAR] In 1667, Jean-Baptiste Denis who was physician to King Louis XIV, performed the transfusion of blood from an animal to a human. Denis transfused the blood from a sheep to a 15-year old boy and later to a labourer, both of whom survived the transfusions. [PAR] Related Stories [PAR] Zika virus infection can break down and damage testes of male mice, new research shows [PAR] In 1818, British obstetrician James Blundell successfully transfused human blood to a patient who had hemorrhaged during childbirth. In 1901, Karl Landsteiner, an Austrian physician discovered the first human blood groups, which helped transfusion to become a safer practice. By performing experiments in which he mixed blood samples taken from his staff, Landsteiner discovered blood groups A, B and O and established the basic principals of ABO compatibility. In 1907, an American surgeon called Reuben Ottenberg suggested that patient and donor blood should be grouped and cross matched before a blood transfusion procedure. [PAR] Between 1914 and 1918, anticoagulants such as sodium citrate were found to prolong the shelf life of blood and refrigeration also proved to be an effective means of preserving blood. In the 1920\u2019s and 30\u2019s, the voluntary donation of blood for storage and use was started. At around the same time, Edwin Cohn developed cold ethanol fractionation, a method of breaking down blood into its component parts to obtain albumin, gamma globulin and fibrinogen, for example. [PAR] During the Second World War, blood transfusion was used on a large scale to treat injured soldiers and became well known as a life saving procedure.[DOC] [TLE] \u201cOn the First Medical Blood Transfusion Between Human ...Matthew Rowlinson, \u201cOn the First Medical Blood Transfusion Between Human Subjects, 1818\u2033 | BRANCH [PAR] Matthew Rowlinson, \u201cOn the First Medical Blood Transfusion Between Human Subjects, 1818\u2033 [PAR] Abstract [PAR] The first experiments in blood transfusion took place in the seventeenth century, using blood drawn from animals. After the death of a French patient and the trial of his physician for manslaughter, transfusion was abandoned for a century and a half. When it resumed in the nineteenth century, the first trials used human blood. They were conducted by the obstetrician James Blundell, who developed transfusion to treat women suffering from hemorrhage after childbirth. During the course of the century, transfusion was applied as a remedy to different kinds of sicknesses and injuries, and performed at different times with various fluids. By the 1880s, British doctors had abandoned transfusion with blood in favor of infusion with saline solution; the practice was only again resumed after the recognition of human blood types in the twentieth century. Developments in the practice of transfusion and infusion during the century reflect shifting views of how gender and species identity are embodied, and of relations of affinity and immunity between bodies of different kinds. They also reflect a shift from a vitalist to a mechanist understanding of blood and its function. [PAR] Download this page in PDF format [PAR] Blood transfusion as a medical practice dates to the seventeenth century; [1] > the first experiments were performed a few decades after William Harvey published his demonstration that blood circulates in the body in De Motu Cordis (1628).\u00a0 Harvey\u2019s discovery showed that blood circulated indefinitely, rather than being either consumed within the body or expelled from it. To cure pathologies of the blood was thus no longer exclusively a matter of stimulating or preventing its evacuation; now the goal was to affect blood\u2019s circulation within the body and its interaction with other organs. The earliest blood transfusions involving human subjects were carried out almost simultaneously in France and England in 1667.

For example, the first event is the initial occurrence or, if planned, the inaugural of the event. One year later would be the first anniversary of that event. The word was first used for Catholic feasts to commemorate saints. [PAR] Anniversary names [PAR] *Birthdays (v.) are the most common type of anniversary, where the birth date of a person is commemorated annually. The actual celebration is sometimes moved for practical reasons, as in the case of an official birthday. [PAR] *Wedding anniversaries are also often celebrated on the same day of the year as the wedding occurred. [PAR] * Death anniversary. [PAR] The Latin phrase dies natalis (literally \"birth day\") has become a common term, adopted in many languages, especially in intellectual and institutional circles, for the anniversary of the founding (\"legal or statutory birth\") of an institution, such as an alma mater (college or other school). Even in ancient Rome, we know of the [dies] Aquilae natalis (\"birthday of the eagle\", anniversary of the official founding of a legion). [PAR] Most countries around the world celebrate national anniversaries, for example the USA Bicentennial. These could be the date of independence of the nation or the adoption of a new constitution or form of government. The important dates in a sitting monarch's reign may also be commemorated, an event often referred to as a \"Jubilee\". [PAR] Anniversaries of nations are usually marked by the number of years elapsed described with Latin words or Roman numerals. [PAR] Latin-derived numerical names [PAR] Latin terms for anniversaries are mostly straightforward, particularly those relating to the first twenty years (1\u201320), those relating to multiples of ten years (30, 40, 60, 70 etc.), and those relating to multiples of centuries or millennia (100, 200, 300, 1000, 2000, 3000 etc.) In these instances, the anniversary generally comes from a derivative of the Latin word for the respective number of years.  However, when anniversaries relate to fractions of centuries (125, 150, 175, 250 years\u2014i.e., 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, and 2.5 centuries), the situation is not as simple. [PAR] Roman fractions were based on a duodecimal system. From  to  they were described as multiples of twelfths (uncia \"twelfth\"; the source of the English words inch and ounce) and from  to  they were described as multiple-twelfths less than the next whole unit\u2014i.e., a whole unit less ,  or  respectively. There were also special terms for quarter (quadrans), half (semis), and three-quarters (dodrans). Dodrans is a Latin contraction of de-quadrans which means \"a whole unit less a quarter\" (de means \"from\"; quadrans means \"quarter\".  Thus for the example of 175 years, the term is a quarter century less than the next whole (bi)century or 175 = (-25 + 200).  [PAR] In Latin it seems that this rule did not apply literally for 1\u00bd. Whereas \"secundus\" is Latin for \"second\", or \"bis\" for \"twice\" these terms are not used such as in sesqui-secundus. Instead just sesqui (or ses) is used by itself. This may be because it relates to a ratio of one\u2014thus it means \"and a half\" compared to \"one\". (It may also be because  in Latin is sescuncia, sescunciae (from sesqui- + uncia, i.e., 1\u00bd uncias) defined as one-and-a-half twelfths ( \u00d7  = ).)

[PAR] Bull's Blood of Eger is a red wine made in Eger, Hungary . One of Hungary's most famous wines , Bull's Blood, or Egri Bikav\u00e9r, is internationally known and connected to an exciting legend from Hungary's past. Bull's Blood can be enjoyed when you visit Hungary \u2014eat it with a hearty bowl of stew or a cut of game meat. Or, if you're serious about wine, visit Eger yourself to sample Bull's Blood from the source. [PAR] Origins of Bull's Blood [PAR] The name of the wine originates from an event that happened in Eger, the town and region where the wine is produced, in the 16th century. Upon a Turkish siege of the city, the Hungarian troops (under command of the favorite hero of Eger today, Istvan Dobo), were fed local food and wine, including the red wine from nearby vineyards. Rumor spread that this dark red wine was mixed with bulls' blood to give the 2,000 soldiers strength. Indeed, this small band of defenders successfully fought back a much larger Turkish army, and Eger was temporarily saved from sacking. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Tipping Etiquette Around the World [PAR] Variations of the legend exist, and it's possible the name Bull's Blood didn't begin to be used until much later. However, the story emphasizes the enduring tradition of Egri Bikav\u00e9r and its importance to the region. [PAR] Egri Bikav\u00e9r's Characteristics [PAR] Bull's Blood of Eger varies in its quality and makeup, so generalizing the wine's characteristics can be difficult to do. The wine is traditionally a blend of three or more grapes, with the Kadarka grape acting as the backbone to the other flavors of the wine. [PAR] During the years of communism in Hungary, efforts to produce higher quantities of wine meant that other grape varieties were favored in producing Bull's Blood. However, the Kadarka grape has since been reintroduced as a mainstay of Egri Bikav\u00e9r. It's still possible to get low-quality or mass-produced Bull's Blood, so if you're trying it out on your own, it's worth it to invest in a better bottle. [PAR] Those who are looking for the highest-quality Egri Bikav\u00e9r should look for the Superior label. At least 5 grape varieties are used in its production, and the wine must be aged before being sold. [PAR] Eger [PAR] Eger is a destination in Hungary that enjoys significance beyond its reputation as the producer of one of Hungary's most well-known wines. Visitors can see the castle where Istvan Dobo and his troops defended Eger, as well as a minaret left over from a demolished mosque. Eger is easy to get to from Budapest, too\u2014trains and buses leave from the capital city regularly and can have you in Eger in under three hours. [PAR] Wine cellars in the Valley of the Beautiful Women welcome visitors to Eger. Here, learn about Bull's Blood and its production. [PAR] However, you don't have to travel to Eger to sample Bull's Blood. Wine in Budapest is a part of the capital city's culture, and Bull's Blood is served at many restaurants by default.

Such was the mystery of the tale of Sweeney Todd, Demon Barber of Fleet Street \u2013 you never quite know what to believe. We investigate just why the Demon Barber is such a believable character and why is he still so popular today, with his very own\u00a0walking tour of London\u00a0to boot. [PAR] The fictional (or was he?) character of Sweeney Todd first appeared in literature in the 1940s. His tale, set in the East End of London, or Brick Lane more specifically; captured the imaginations and weariness of Londoners and the rest of the world wasn\u2019t far behind. The barber with a grudge against the world preys on victims in his barber\u2019s chairs and polishes them off by having them baked into meat pies. [PAR] This is a believable story for numerous reasons. Firstly, rumours of pies being made from cats and horse-meat were flying around London in the early 1900s. Secondly, storytellers such as Dickens added depth to the story by including the character in his books and plays on the popular tale opening with cautions that the story they were about to witness was based on fact. This certainly added weight to the notion that Sweeney Todd was, in fact, a real serial killer. [PAR] The believability of the story merely added to its reputation and the story had soon spread to the United States. More and more version abounded, and the rumours pertaining to it being a true story were now as commonplace as bread and butter. [PAR] Over the years, the story has been told and re-crafted many times; there have been books, musical plays, films, comics, radio plays and enchanting scores. The story has proven so popular throughout history that it was even inspired our very own\u00a0Sweeney Todd tour\u00a0\u2013 taking place weekly in the East End of London.

[PAR] Sweeney was born on 16th October 1756 in Brick Lane, then a rural country lane that led out to the brickfields of Bethnal Green. Todd's mother was a silk-winder and his father a silk weaver, working for the French Huguenots in nearby Norton Folgate, Spitalfields. [PAR] In 1770, aged only 14 years, Sweeney Todd was sentenced to a five year term in Newgate Prison wrongly accused of stealing a pocket watch. While in prison he met up with an old barber named Elmer Plummer, who was serving ten years for fraud.

The heroine was filled with doubts and surrounded by doubters; most of all she was  troubled by voices which (to the clicking of their busy typewriters) read aloud to her the novel of which she was a  helpless part.  Eventually she recovered and wrote the novel herself.  It was called \"The Comforters,\" the first of a  remarkable series of comic tales, of which \"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\" is the latest. [PAR] Muriel Spark has a persistent religious theme, the problem of fusing matter and spirit.  Her novels are filled with  puritanical souls suspicious of the flesh, with charlatans who exploit the yearning for pure spirituality, with old people  who cling to outworn bodies and young people who are baffled by the mysteries of the flesh.   In \"Memento Mori,\"  the octogenarians resentfully receive phone calls that remind them they must die.  In \"The Bachelors,\" a demonic  spiritualist seeks his physical release in murder while he conducts s\ufffdances.  The devil of \"The Ballad of Peckham  Rye\" undoes marriages, and the austere puritan in \"Robinson\" writes attacks on the dangers of Marian doctrine. [PAR] It is, in fact, the doctrine of the Incarnation, the mysterious \"acceptance of matter,\" that provides the point of view  from which Ms. Spark can see, with both clarity and warmth, the plight of divided or incomplete people.  She writes  with cool exactness, a firm voice (each tale has its own) and compassionate wit.  In her new novel (originally  published last fall, in shorter form, in The New Yorker), she deals with a violent woman whose romantic spirit is  impatient with all but the Absolute. [PAR] Most of us have known someone like Miss Jean Brodie.  She may have been a teacher, as in Mrs. Spark's novel, a  somewhat disreputable aunt or an unspeakable cousin, perhaps the mother of one's best friend.  Miss Brodie is a  preposterous woman.  She seizes upon the docile little girls (in a respectable Edinburgh school during the Nineteen  Thirties) and makes them her elect, her \"cr\ufffdme de la cr\ufffdme.\"  She spins tales of her dead lover; she tells them about  Giotto, she introduces them to the secrets of cosmetics; she tries to make them Europeans instead of dowdy little  provincials.  Miss Brodie's hectic and undisciplined enthusiasms include fascism as well as Tennyson; each is an approach to the Absolute she seeks.  For Miss Brodie has triumphantly entered her \"prime.\"  She speaks of it with  such conviction that it becomes a visible presence to her girls, like a splendid garment.  And yet, ridiculous as it is,  Miss Brodie's prime is a vitality of spirit that is just as real as the girls imagined. [PAR] Mrs. Spark moves back and forth in time.  We follow the six girls of Miss Brodie's \"set\" from their tenth year to  their eighteenth, but we also see their middle age and look back at Miss Brodie from beyond her prime, her betrayal  and her death.  The central problem of the book is the connection we gradually discover between the vivid posturings  of the domineering teacher and the image of one of her girls, now Sister Helena, author of a psychological treatise  called \"The Transfiguration of the Commonplace,\" a nun who nervously grasps the bars of her cell as she receives  her visitors.  For, of all of Miss Brodie's girls, it is not Eunice (\"famous for her spritely gymnastics and glamourous  swimming\") or Rose (\"famous for sex\") who feels her influence and becomes her counterpart; it is Sandy Stranger,  the clever, imaginative one.

She was the fifteenth and penultimate child of Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor and Empress Maria Theresa.   In April 1770, upon her marriage to Louis-Auguste, Dauphin of France, she became Dauphine of France.

[PAR] Within the kingdom of France, a growing number of the population eventually came to dislike her, accusing L'Autrichienne, \"the Austrian woman\", (a nickname given her upon her arrival to France by Louis XV's daughters, Mesdames de France), of being profligate, promiscuous, and of harbouring sympathies for France's enemies, particularly Austria, her country of origin. The Diamond Necklace affair damaged her reputation further.

[PAR] Adipose Tissue [PAR] Adipose tissue is a lipid storing type of loose connective tissue . Also called fat tissue, adipose is composed primarily of adipose cells or adipocytes. While adipose tissue can be found in a number of places in the body, it is found primarily beneath the skin . Adipose is also located between muscles and around internal organs, particularly those in the abdominal cavity. The energy stored as fat in adipose tissue is used as a fuel source by the body after the available energy acquired from carbohydrates is used up. In addition to storing fat , adipose tissue also produces endocrine hormones which regulate adipocyte activity and are necessary for the regulation of other vital bodily processes. Adipose tissue helps to cushion and protect organs, as well as insulate the body from heat loss. [PAR] Adipose Tissue Composition [PAR] The majority of cells found in adipose tissue are adipocytes. Adipocytes contain droplets of stored fat (triglycerides) that can be used for energy. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Test Your General Science Knowledge [PAR] These cells swell or shrink depending on whether fat is being stored or used. Other types of cells that comprise adipose tissue include fibroblasts, white blood cells , nerves , and endothelial cells . Adipocytes are derived from precursor cells that develop into one of three types of adipose tissue: white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, or beige adipose tissue. The majority of adipose tissue in the body is white.\u00a0White adipose tissue stores energy and helps to insulate the body, while\u00a0brown adipose burns energy and generates heat.\u00a0Beige adipose is genetically different from both brown and white adipose, but burns calories to release energy like brown adipose. Beige fat cells also have the ability to boost their energy burning capabilities in response to cold. Both brown and beige fat get their color from the abundance of blood vessels and presence of iron containing mitochondria throughout the tissue. Mitochondria are cell organelles that convert energy into forms that are usable by the cell. Beige adipose can also be produced from white adipose cells. [PAR] Adipose Tissue Location [PAR] Adipose tissue is found in various places in the body. Some of these locations include the subcutaneous layer under the skin; around the heart , kidneys , and nerve tissue ; in yellow bone marrow and breast tissue; and within the buttocks, thighs, and abdominal cavity. While white fat accumulates in these areas, brown fat is located in more specific areas of the body. In adults, small deposits of brown fat are found on the upper back, the side of the neck, the shoulder area, and along the spine . Infants have a greater percentage of brown fat than do adults. This fat can be found on most of the back region and is important for generating heat. [PAR] Adipose Tissue Endocrine Function [PAR] Adipose tissue acts as an endocrine system organ by generating hormones that influence metabolic activity in other organ systems . Some of the hormones produced by adipose cells influence sex hormone metabolism, blood pressure regulation, insulin sensitivity, fat storage and use, blood clotting, and cell signaling. A major function of adipose cells is to increase the body's sensitivity to insulin, thereby protecting against obesity. Fat tissue produces the hormone adiponectin which acts on the brain to increase metabolism, promote the break down of fat , and increase energy use in muscles without affecting appetite. All of these actions help to reduce body weight and reduce the risk of developing conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

If you have any questions related                to your Raclette Australia raclette grill, cheese, potatoes, raclette                in general or this website, please send us feedback via our feedback                form . [PAR] We love to hear from you! [PAR] What cheese is traditionally                used with a raclette grill and where can I buy it? [PAR] Authentic raclette cheese is produced in the French speaking regions                in the Swiss Alps. It can be described as a semi hard cheese, yellowish                colour, virtually no holes with light brown rind. Australia also                produces its own raclette cheeses: Fromart                Raclette , Maleny                Raclette and Heidi                Farm Raclette Cheese and in New Zealand you can buy Ferndale                Raclette . Raclette cheese is famous because the flavour and                aroma intensifies when melted and its texture remains smooth during                grilling. Visit your department store food hall in your major capital                city and see whether they stock it. Authentic French made \"Raclette                Rouge\" that is available only at exclusive cheese stores is                a must to try but it is a bit on the expensive side. Check out where                you can buy                raclette cheese in your state. [PAR] What kind of other cheeses can I use                on my raclette and where can I buy it? [PAR] In Australia two cheeses which are also ideal for raclette are                available from the gourmet cheese section at Woolworths supermarkets.                A German made cheese called \"Alpsberg\" is highly recommended.                It is a delicious cheese with excellent melting qualities with a                great flavour. The other is Australian made Swiss style cheese called \"Aussie Swiss Gold\" which has a great sweet nutty flavour.                Other Swiss cheeses such as Emmenthal or Gruyere are also perfectly                suitable are available from large delicatessens. Mozzarella mixed                with grated Parmesan and Romano cheese is also good. It is recommended                that you mix some mozzarella (grated or fresh) with the Alpsberg                cheese to balance the moisture content. [PAR] How do I use a raclette grill? [PAR] The raclette grill is placed in the middle of a large enough table                and ingredients that have been prepared beforehand are placed around                it. Each guest has an individual pan or two and compiles their chosen                ingredients onto the pan with a slice of cheese on top and then                places it under the grill to melt. In the meantime you can enjoy                a sip of wine and nice company while you wait. The stone plate can                be used to keep the potatoes warm. Guests can use two pans if there                are enough to go around and this can reduce the waiting time. Pre-cooked                ingredients like leftovers can also be used on your raclette. If                guests prefer they can use the top of the grill to cook their vegetables                for a crispier taste instead of in their pans. [PAR] What should I remember when buying                ingredients for my raclette party? [PAR] The flavour, nutritional content and colour of most natural foods                are at their best when they are bought fresh. If you are going to                grill meat on the top plates, ensure the meat is bought on the day                and do not use them if frozen. Potatoes are best cooked using a                steaming method to retain the nutrients that sit just under the                skin. How much cheese to serve depends on the number of guests and                whether they are used to eating lots of cheese. Eating slowly and                enjoying the simple and natural flavours of wholesome foods is the                secret to a satisfying meal. Take pleasure in small portions and                rest in between. Leftover ingredients can easily be used for pizza                toppings or another raclette party the next day. [PAR] How can I make organising a raclette party                even easier? [PAR] The beauty of a raclette party is that the preparation can be so                simple. Most ingredients will just need for you to cut them up into                small pieces or opening up a jar or can and presenting it all on                nice plates and bowls. [PAR] Your guests may like to help contribute to the organising of the party and could bring                some\n\n\n### Answer:\ncheeses </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Funny Folks began as a supplement to the Weekly Budget. Its popularity led to it being published as a separate weekly paper. The success of Funny Folks encouraged the publication of other weekly comics. One such comic was the famous Victorian comic, Ally Sloper\u2019s Half Holiday (1884 - 1916). Ally Sloper\u2019s Half Holiday was the inspiration of the engraver and publisher, Gilbert Dalziel. Ally Sloper had a characteristic red nose, battered top hat and he was usually drunk. Ally Sloper is notably the first ever comic strip hero and undoubtedly laid the foundations for the likes of Chubblock Homes -(Comic Cuts), Weary Willie and Tired Tim - (Illustrated Chips), Roy of the Rovers - (Tiger), Desperate Dan - (The Dandy), Dan Dare - (The Eagle) and more recently Judge Dredd - (2000AD). These are but a few names from the canon of British Comic heroes [PAR] The late 1890\u2019s saw an explosion in comic publishing. Alfred Harmsworth \u2019s Comic Cuts (1890 - 1953) cost just half a penny, which was half the cost of its contemporaries. Comic Cuts soon had competition from rival publishers with titles such as Funny Cuts (1890 - 1920). Harmsworths response was to bring out further titles of his own including Illustrated Chips. Although these publications were classed as comics, they were primarily aimed at and published for an adult audience. Comics for young children (Nursery Comics) didn\u2019t start being published until the early years of the twentieth century. Rainbow (1914 - 1956) is generally accepted as the first children\u2019s comic although Puck (1904 - 1940) did have a junior section after issue eleven and gradually became a children\u2019s comic. [PAR] The 1930\u2019s are known as the Golden age of comics. The Golden age saw the appearance of comics like Tiny Tots (1927 - 1959), Crackers (1929 - 1941), The Dandy (1937 - Present) and The Beano (1938 - Present). Both the Beano and the Dandy appeared just prior to the outbreak of the 2nd World War and their timing can be considered fortunate because paper shortages led to laws prohibiting the launching of new comics during the war years. The Beano and Dandy became a vanguard of a new era with the introduction of a new size and style of comic artistry, which included the introduction of speech bubbles in some of the stories.Puck was the first comic to print a s substantial number of its pages in colour but it wasn\u2019t until Mickey Mouse Weekly (1936 - 1955) that a comic was published completely in full colour photogravure. Photogravure is a picture produced from a photographic negative and transferred to a metal plate where it is etched on. [PAR] The 1950\u2019s is known as the Silver Age and it saw the appearance of a more sophisticated type of comic epitomised by the Eagle (1950 - 1969) with its hero Dan Dare. The silver age comics were post war publications and gone were the paper shortages of the war years, these comics were printed on a better quality paper with full photogravure.The success of the two DC Thomson titles (Beano and Dandy) led Thomson\u2019s rivals, The Amalgamated Press, to launch two of their own rival comics namely Radio Fun (1938 - 1961) and Knockout (1939 -1963). Although The Beano and Dandy are still continuing to be published, Radio Fun and Knockout ended their days in the early 1960\u2019s. In July 1939 DC Thomson had launched a comic called The Magic Comic (1939 - 1941) but it was short lived due to the over saturation of the comics market at that time. The Dandy continues to be the oldest British comic still in publication. [PAR] No history of British comics would be complete without paying homage to the great Denis Gifford who was born on Boxing day 1927. Gifford's contribution to British comics both as a contributor in the 1940s and 1950s,\u00a0 including Flip & Flop'\n\n\n### Answer:\neagle </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Some of the world's most renowned artists are Spanish painters and Spanish sculptors have also left their mark on society. In fact, Spain has such a strong artistic tradition that Spanish art has become a leading attraction for tourism. [PAR] Some famous Spanish sculptors include Mariano Benlliure, Vasco de la Zarza, Juan Bautista Monegro, Alonso Berruguete and many more. [PAR] The origins of painting in Spain can be traced back to illuminate manuscripts and mural decorations. \u00a0During the 16th and 17th centuries, considered Spain's Golden Age, many famous Spanish painters emerged including artists like Diego Velazquez, El Greco, Francisco Ribera and Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo while Francisco de Goya dominated Spanish painting in the 18th century. [PAR] Some of the most famous Spanish painters of the 20th century include Joan Miro, Juan Gris, Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso. Picasso is considered to be the most innovative Spanish artists of the 20th century with famous masterpieces such as his Guernica painting. Picasso's work along with those of other famous Spanish painters are highly regarded and valued by important art galleries around the world. [PAR] Las Meninas (The Maids of Honor) by Diego Velazquez, is one of the most important and most viewed Spanish paintings in the world. [PAR] There are many more important Spanish painters and Spanish sculptors that have left an impressive legacy in the art world. In this section, we hope that you can find more about Spanish artists and sculptors and learn about them.[DOC] [TLE] Spanish Painting: History, Characteristics - Art EncyclopediaSpanish Painting: History, Characteristics [PAR] Spanish Painting [PAR] Sold in 2004 For $104.2 million [PAR] Spanish Painting (c.1500-1970) [PAR] The best-known of all portraits of [PAR] the Spanish Baroque. [PAR] see: Greatest Paintings Ever . [PAR] Introduction [PAR] The greatness of Spain in painting is found          in a select few artists who rise so far above their fellows that they          occupy the very summit of European art. They are El          Greco (1541-1614), Diego          Velazquez (1599-1660), and Francisco          de Goya (1746 1828). Some similarity can be found between their          eminence and that of Rembrandt in Holland and Rubens in the Spanish Netherlands,          though not only had the Netherlands, north and south, a greater number          of lesser Old Masters , and more artists          who displayed a large measure of originality at a distinguished level,          but also a more consistent line of evolution. [PAR] It is possible to underrate such Spanish          painters as Ribera and Zurbaran in comparison with the manifestly greater          trio, but the course of Spanish art is broken and hesitant apart from          the tremendous affirmations of the few individuals. If one seeks for a          root cause in early history it is necessary to go back to when most of          the Iberian peninsula was under the rule of the Moslem invaders. In 1100,          remember, the Moors still occupied two-thirds of the region. [PAR] A gradual reconquest was made by the Christian          regions, reclaiming the land bit by bit and planting churches and their          visual message in one district after another. In Catalonia works still          preserved in the museums of Barcelona convey the force of this active          Christianity in paintings in a majestic Romanesque style. It was not until          near the end of the fifteenth century that Spain was united as a country.          The kingdoms of Castile and Aragon were joined together in 1479 under          Ferdinand and Isabella. The Moors were driven from their last foothold          - Granada - in 1492, The long drawn-out struggle made the extension of          painting a slow and uneven process. The province of Catalonia - the earliest          to be freed from Moslem occupation - had the advantage, in the Gothic          period of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, of contacts with France          and Italy, faintly reflected in the work of Ferrer Bassa (c.1290-1348).

The phonetic alphabet is a system created by the NATO allies in the 1950s that would be intelligible and pronounceable to all NATO allies in the heat of battle. It has another name - the radiotelephony spelling alphabet. It requires words to be spelled out by their letters; for example, arm becomes Alpha Romeo Mike, and south becomes Sierra Oscar Uniform Tango Hotel. All the letters sound different, so there is no confusion over long distances over what people are saying. The reason that any phonetic alphabet is (or was) used is because telephone , radio and walkie-talkie communications had the habit of crackling over long distances, blotting out whole words or even sentences. The normal alphabet cannot be used, because some letters, for example P, B, C and D sound similar, and over long distances were indistinguishable, so a new method had to be found. When the code was invented it was also considered that consonants are the most difficult to hear against a noisy background. Hence the sequence of vowels in the phonetic code played an important role when the code was invented, so that when you hear a noisy '-oo-oo' you know the letter is a Z. The vowel-sequence thing works for most (though not all) combinations of letters. All of the words are recognisable by native English speakers because English must be used upon request for communication between an aircraft and a control tower whenever two nations are involved, regardless of their native languages. But it is only required internationally, not domestically, thus if both parties to a radio conversation are from the same country, then another phonetic alphabet of that nation's choice may be used. [PAR] The NATO Phonetic Alphabet is not the only phonetic alphabet in use, but it definitely is the one used by the most people and countries. From humble beginnings as only being for the NATO allies, it has spread, becoming used in a huge variety of everyday situations. It is used widely in telecommunications and business, as well as being used for call signs for hikers going through areas of bush or forest; and being the internationally recognised way of communicating at sea and by air, using the NATO phonetic alphabet means you can get what you are saying through wherever you are in the world. It is therefore a very helpful way of communicating information. [PAR] Previous Versions [PAR] Before the acceptance of the NATO phonetic alphabet, the British already had their own version. It was as follows: [PAR] A - Abel [PAR] I - In (or Indigo) [PAR] R - Roger (or Robert) [PAR] After the war, because many of the pilots and engineers had been taken from commercial flights, the phonetic alphabet became commonly used in civilian communications. But as many sounds were unique to English, different countries started making their own. For example, an alternative 'Ana Brazil' alphabet was used in Latin America. But the International Air Transport Association (IATA), recognising the need for a single universal alphabet, presented a draft alphabet to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in 1947. It had sounds common to English, French, and Spanish, and after further study and modification by each approving body, the revised alphabet was implemented November 1, 1951, and is as follows: [PAR] A - Alfa [PAR] I - India [PAR] R - Romeo [PAR] Immediately, problems were found with this version. Some users felt that the list was so hard to follow that they reverted to the old 'able baker' alphabet. To identify the deficiencies of the new alphabet, testing was conducted among speakers from 31 nations, mainly by the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States.

As the host of Man V Food \u2013 one of the greatest TV shows of our time \u2013 he's gleefully ploughed his way through culinary monstrosities like a seven-pound burrito, a metre-long bratwurst, and a 12-patty cheeseburger without even breaking a sweat. So, Adam, what's for lunch? Seventeen sandwiches? A moped-sized steak? The contents of the nearest pet shop? [PAR] \"I'm not sure,\" he says over the phone from Atlanta. \"I'm speaking at my undergrad today, so I'm a jumble of nerves right now. I don't know if I'm going to eat at all.

If you ask a stranger about Man V Food, and they respond by widening their eyes, gasping with recognition and frantically recounting all the vast wodges of meat they've seen Richman demolish, you know you'll be in good company. [PAR] Slowly, by word of mouth, it has blossomed into something of a cultural touchstone for a generation. The premise is disarmingly simple: one man travels around various American pig-out spots \u2013 the kind of fast and dirty eateries where you're given a free T-shirt if you can stuff an entire farmyard into your mouth in an hour \u2013 and essentially eats everything in sight.

[PAR] If that sounds obscene, it's because it often is. Stumble across an even slightly meat-centric episode of Man V Food and you'll be presented by wave after wave of glistening animal carcass in gruesome close-up, all charred and fatty and dripping with barbecue sauce. It can sometimes come dangerously close to the old Wonder Showzen Hot Dog Factory sketch , where kids narrate footage of meat production by remarking \"Delicious murder\" and \"That's the dark nature of capitalism\".

The Act of Supremacy 1534 confirmed the King's status as having supremacy over the church and required the nobility to swear an oath recognizing Henry's supremacy. [2] Henry's daughter, Queen Mary I , attempted to restore the English Church's allegiance to the Pope and repealed the Act of Supremacy in 1555. [3] Elizabeth I took the throne in 1558 and the next year Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy 1559 that restored the original act. [4] To placate critics the Oath of Supremacy , which nobles were required to swear, gave the monarch's title as Supreme Governor rather than Supreme Head of the church. This wording avoided the charge that the monarchy was claiming divinity or usurping Jesus Christ, whom the Bible identifies as head of the church. [5] [PAR] \"Defender of the Faith\" ( Fidei Defensor ) has been part of the British monarch's title since Henry VIII was granted it by Pope Leo X in 1521 in recognition of Henry's role in opposing the Protestant Reformation .

We have therefore, upon mature Deliberation, and with the Advice of so many of Our Bishops as might conveniently be called together, thought fit to make this Declaration following ...

Enjoying rapid economic growth and a dazzling record win in World Cups past, Brazil was poised to establish itself as a major global economic power in 2014. Unfortunately, rampant spending and countless missed deadlines in recent years have left citizens outraged and the government scrambling to finish preparations,\u00a0even in the weeks leading up to the Cup. [PAR] This fall from grace is distressing, but the financial and social struggles currently making headlines are reminiscent of the last World Cup. In light of recent events in Brazil and those in 2010 in host-nation South Africa, one must consider the fact that, for countries with developing economies, hosting major international events such as the World Cup can inflict serious economic and social harm. [PAR] Brazil\u2019s World Cup woes arguably began even before it was chosen as the 2014 host. FIFA\u2019s bidding process costs millions of dollars and requires that competing nations promise lavish stadiums and hotels for FIFA officials. According to FIFA, this is money well invested; the organization argues that nations which host the famous tournament enjoy increased economic growth due to the tourist revenue as well as opportunities to host other sporting events in the new stadiums that the organization demands be built. [PAR] Most countries also take World Cup hosting as an impetus to infrastructure improvements such as roads, subway construction, and airport renovation\u2014projects that have long-term benefits for the nation. Brazil\u2019s response\u00a0to the opportunity to host, however, has been to spend a record-breaking $11.5 billion while failing to complete most of the projects it initiates. At the end of May, football legend and member of the World Cup organizing committee Cristiano Ronaldo admitted that only 30 percent of the proposed projects will see completion, and officials are concerned that the country\u2019s still largely outdated airports will be unable to handle the influx of visitors from abroad. [PAR] Even after they arrive, World Cup spectators may be underwhelmed with the games\u2019 venues: an estimated $3.6 billion of taxpayer money has gone into the construction and renovation of massive stadiums, most of which were incomplete as of the end of May and are unlikely to see proper use after the 20th World Cup comes to a close. [PAR] A large portion of the Brazilian population is up in arms over the astronomical cost of preparing for the World Cup and the utter lack of progress achieved. Citizen protests have attracted international attention\u2014it seems that despite their\u00a0enthusiasm for football, Brazil's citizens have had enough of their government spending billions on a month-long tournament while their schools and hospitals suffer. Their countless demonstrations are likely to continue throughout the Cup. [PAR] Troubling strikes also have threatened Brazil in the weeks leading up to the Cup. In S\u00e3o Paulo, civil police have gone on strike over low pay. Bus workers also brought the city to its knees in late May when they abandoned their posts, surprising both commuters and officials by parking their buses (or leaving them in the streets) and closing down several terminals. If the government fails to address these professional strikes during the World Cup, the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo will be unsafe and impossible to navigate, harming visitors and citizens alike. [PAR] Brazil\u2019s homeless populations have also protested, with thousands of displaced families setting up camp in a lot near the S\u00e3o Paulo stadium set to hold the Cup\u2019s opening game. The camp, which the families have named 'The People's Cup,' will impede traffic to the games and serve as a reminder to tourists and locals alike of the suffering among Brazil's poor populations.\u00a0Such widespread civil unrest is raising eyebrows worldwide as football fans across the globe, along with Brazilian officials, become increasingly concerned that the World Cup will fail to run as planned.

He still manages to sing Gilbert & Sullivan parts in Britain, occasionally. But most of his activity now seems to be in that hotbed of Anglophilism, the prodigal colonies of the United States of America. Mr. Reed serves as stage director of the Colorado Music Festival in Boulder and appears in comic roles - mostly Gilbert & Sullivan, of course - hither and yon. [PAR] ''Yon'' means Washington and Los Angeles, among others. ''Hither'' means the New York Gilbert & Sullivan Players at Symphony Space, where Mr. Reed appeared last season as King Gama in ''Princess Ida'' and where he opened a run of performances as the Duke of Plaza-Toro in ''The Gondoliers'' on Friday night. The run will continue, off and on, through Jan. 6, with a one-night coda Jan. 12 at the Palace Theater in Stamford, Conn. [PAR] ''The Gondoliers,'' subtitled ''The King of Barataria,'' was the 12th collaboration between W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. It was first performed at the Savoy Theater in London in December 1889, and counts as their last really popular work. [PAR] The strains in their collaboration had to do with Sullivan's increasing ambitions as a serious composer. ''The Gondoliers'' contains far more developed music, and more extensive music, than the rest of the popular Savoyard canon. [PAR] To this taste, that means it is less successful; the Americans were right in responding to this operetta cooly when it was first exported. Sullivan was a deft and tuneful craftsman, but the genius of these two lay in Gilbert's dialogue and patter songs and his improbable situations. In ''The Gondoliers,'' there is entirely too much song-and-dance frolicking to minimal comical purpose. [PAR] Sullivan's musical ambitions, in turn, placed more stringent demands on the principal singers here than in most other Savoyard shows. Like most Gilbert & Sullivan troupes, English or American, the New York company is shy of really secure, attractive operatic voices. Much of the singing on Friday was thin at best, and smiling charm couldn't quite compensate. [PAR] Still, Gilbert's wicked satire still surfaces in this score, and Mr. Reed and his cohorts made a nice turn of it. Actually, Mr. Reed seemed a little muted on this occasion, and was thus fully matched by Anthony Tamburello as the leeringly evil Grand Inquisitor; Mr. Tamburello is no great shakes as a singer, but he delivers comic dialogue superbly. And Keith Jurosko, in the shorter part of Luiz, made a wonderfully soulful, earnest comic-romantic. [PAR] This is not to say that the other principals were unworthy of notice: Joanna Levy, Paul Tomasko, Richard Holmes, Carol Wolfe, Ellen Scrofani and Cheryl Fenner all had their merits. But greater musical distinction came from the pit, where Albert Bergeret led a nicely tuned, buoyantly idiomatic acount of the score, well played and with stalwart choral singing, as well. [PAR] Mr. Bergeret, who founded this company in 1974, was also responsible for the stage direction, which was crisply managed if sometimes just a touch amateurishly executed. William Fleet Lively was the choreographer; Beverly Bullock and Edmond Felix did the colorful costumes, and Sally Small was credited with the simple lighting scheme. [PAR] Mostly, as director, Mr. Bergeret stuck to tradition, with an occasional fresh touch not seen in every ''Gondoliers'' production (e.g., Inez, the foster mother who unravels - or is it ravels? - the plot at the end, as a violin-playing orchestra member plucked from the pit). The sets, waving wrinkled in the breeze, looked as if they dated from the dawn of time, or at least 1889.\n\n\n### Answer:\ngondoliers </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

[PAR] Australia is the most arid continent on earth. Water was, and is, one of the most important resources. Taking 25 years to build, consisting of 16 major dams, seven power stations, a pumping station, and 225 kilometers (140 miles) of interconnected tunnels, pipelines and aqueducts, with a labor force of over 100,000, Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric was nominated by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the greatest engineering achievements of the 20th century. [PAR] YOU WILL BE PEOPLE OF THE SNOWY [PAR] Although immense in area, at the time (1940s) Australia had fewer than 10 million people, mainly of British or Irish ancestry. Many residents already had jobs, so were not necessarily available for the massive construction effort contemplated by a government in need of energy for its growing cities. [PAR] But there was an answer to this critical problem. Just as the Transcontinental Railroad in the United States attracted soldiers then unemployed after the Civil war, so too after World War II many people not only unemployed but made homeless by changes in their native lands. Displaced person camps in Europe became recruiting venues for Australia\u2019s first commissioner of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Plant. [PAR] Sir William Hudson, From National Library of Australia, at nla.gov.au [PAR] Sir William Hudson traveled to Europe, inviting displaced people to work on the project and adopt a new life: \u201cYou won\u2019t be Balts or Slavs\u2026you will be people of the Snowy!\u201d [PAR] People who came from around the world were well trained, not just in hydroelectric construction. Free English language classes were provided to all who needed to learn the language. In the town of Cooma, previously a small settlement, the population swelled from 2,000 to 10,000; later Cooma would become the headquarters of the Snowy Mountains Authority. Thousands of new Australians entered the high country. Their children went to school together, came home with playmates from a different culture. When the towns of Adaminaby and Jindabyne had to be flooded to become reservoirs, residents were dispersed, some joining the new communities built for workers. It is said that Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Power contributed to transforming Australia into a more heterogeneous society. [PAR] 90 SECONDS TO SUCCESS [PAR] It is helpful to know at least two things about hydroelectricity: 1) no greenhouse gases are produced that can harm the environment, and 2) it is instantly available, whereas other forms, like coal-based power plants, can take hours to emerge. Therefore, hydroelectricity is an excellent system for coping with fluctuating demand. It takes less than 90 seconds to make extra power available. However, dams are not without environmental consequences. [PAR] SNOW AS NATURAL \u2013 AND NATIONAL \u2013 RESOURCE [PAR] Since the 19th century, Australia had discussed how to take advantage of the snow melt of its mountains, using the water for irrigation. Once it was also possible to generate electricity, there was increasing support for the idea. Did it all start in 1884 when the surveyor-general of New South Wales, P.F. Adams, proposed building a dam just above the confluence of two rivers, the Snowy\u00a0 and the Eucumbene, then channeling the water through a canal that would cut across a small gap he spotted in the Great Dividing Range, where it would rejoin the water in the Murrumbidgee River? [PAR] Snowy built upon Adams\u2019 idea. Rain showers fall and the snow melts. The moisture would normally form lakes. Tunnels were built with pressurized pipelines to carry water from the lakes (or human-made reservoirs) to a power station. There, turbines drive generators and electricity is created by the energy of the rate of falling water (for steep falls, medium, and mild, there are different sizes of turbines; Snowy mainly uses a medium-size turbine called a Francis). After it has been used to generate electricity, the water can be stored, used for irrigation or returned to the lakes\n\n\n### Answer:\nnew south wales </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Lindemans Pomme [PAR] Gayot.com [PAR] Brouwerij Lindemans - Vlezenbeek, Belgium [PAR] The Lindemans brewery has its roots as a family farm with a small brewery that began the commercial brewing of lambic ales in 1811. The fruit seasoning this lambic is apple (pomme is French for apple). Long before hops were common in most beers, fruits and herbs were used as bittering agents! As with all Belgian lambics, immediately after being brewed the beer is left in vats open to the outside air, where it is fermented by a variety of wild yeasts. The yeast provides plenty of tartness, as do the fresh apples that are added during a secondary fermentation. This apple lambic pours a light golden hue with a thick foamy head of tightly packed bubbles. An aroma of sweet and sour apple dominates, which may remind you of a Sour Apple Jolly Rancher candy. A Granny Smith Apple sweet and sour flavor continues as you sip, with sweetness up front turning to tartness in the aftertaste.

He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as \"The Waltz King\", and was largely responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century. [PAR] Strauss was born in St. Ulrich (now a part of Neubau), the son of Johann Strauss I, another composer of dance music. His father did not wish him to become a composer, but rather a banker; however, the son defied his father's wishes, and went on to study music with the composer Joseph Drechsler and the violin with Anton Kollmann, the ballet r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur of the Vienna Court Opera. Strauss had two younger brothers, Josef and Eduard Strauss, who became composers of light music as well, although they were never as well-known as their elder brother. [PAR] Some of Johann Strauss's most famous works include The Blue Danube, Vienna Waltz, Kaiser-Walzer, Tales from the Vienna Woods, the Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka, and the Pizzicato Polka. Among his operettas, Die Fledermaus and Der Zigeunerbaron are the most well-known.

It was accompanied by popular music that was played, whistled and hummed all around the globe. It was called the waltz and its story is inseparable from the story of one family. A family named Strauss. [PAR] This docu-drama, entertainingly presented by Lesley Garrett, tells the story of the Waltz and the Strauss family. The Strauss family kept Vienna and much of the rest of the world dancing for over a hundred years. However the father and son composers, who both held the public title of \"The Waltz King,\" were uneasy rivals in their private life. [PAR] Johann Strauss Senior, born in 1804, was a hugely popular composer, at home and abroad, who transformed the waltz from a simple dance into a Viennese cultural phenomenon. But despite the great acclaim he enjoyed in his lifetime, his reputation has been entirely eclipsed by his eldest son Johann Strauss Junior took the waltz to a whole new musical level. He wrote some of the most popular tunes ever, including The Blue Danube, and ended up a household name around the globe. However although Strauss Junior travelled further, composed greater music and was altogether privately and publicly more successful, in his own mind, he never quite escaped the shadow of his father. [PAR] Lesley Garrett explores the origins of the waltz \u2013 the music, the dance steps, the ballrooms, the costumes and at the same time narrates the drama of the two great Waltz composers, a bitter conflict between a father and a son. This rich and compelling story is lavishly illustrated with the music and dancing of the time, recreated in Vienna's sumptuous Hofburg Palace.

Across the center white stripe are two green five-pointed stars, spaced evenly in the center. [PAR] The Syrian flag incorporates the four pan-Arab colors, which represent the various dynasties that ruled the region in history. The combination of colors was first used to represent the region during the 1916 Arab Revolt. [PAR] The red symbolizes the Khawarij, an Islamic group of the seventh century, whose flag was red. The red also symbolizes the Hashemites. The white represents the Umayyad Dynasty, who used white as their color of mourning. The Umayyads Caliphate lasted from 661 to 750. Black symbolizes the Prophet Mohammad as well as the Abbasid Caliphate. The green, which is less prominent on the Syrian flag than on many other Arabic nations, represents the Fatimid Caliphate. Another set of meanings are ascribed to the colors in Syria's flag: red for the sacrifices made in the fight for freedom, white for peace, black for Syria's colonial history.

An adult can eat up to 500 g of leaves daily. Since the leaf of  eucalyptus has large quantities of water, koalas almost do not drink water, the  reason for which they were named \u201cKoala\u201d; in the language of the Aborigines,  koala means \u201cwho do not drink.\u201d [PAR] Koalas are very picky about  their food. [PAR] Koalas love leaves.  An adult koala is a leaf - eater. It eats eucalyptus leaves. When koalas are  not sleeping, they are usually eating or looking for food. They do not have to  look far, since their diet is made up almost entirely of eucalyptus leaves. Over  600 types of eucalyptus trees grow in Australia, but a koala will eat the  leaves of only two or three kinds. It occasionally eats leaves from other trees  as well, such as tea and cherry trees. Not all koalas like the same kinds of  leaves. [PAR] A koala\u2019s  taste depends partly on where it lives. Each koala has its own favorite local  trees from which it eats. Having a restricted diet like this causes big  problems for koalas when their favorite food source is under threat or in short  supply. [PAR] A single  koala may eat just two types of eucalyptus all of its life. This is partly  because it does not like to change. Once a young koala starts to eat the leaves  of the trees in its home range, it tries to feed on the same kind, year after  year. [PAR] Each  region of Australia  has its own types of eucalyptus, and most woodlands contains only a few of  these. So koalas in the northeast eat different eucalyptus leaves than those in  the southeast. [PAR] Daily Diet [PAR] A 1- year \u2013 old koala eats about 11 oz. (300g.) of food each day. [PAR] A full \u2013 grown koala, about 3 years old, can eat up to 1.1 lb. (500g.) daily [PAR] The koalas are one of nature\u2019s most fussy  eaters. It will only eat the leaves and young shoots of the eucalyptus tree. It  also eats the tree\u2019s stems, flowers, and bark, but it likes the leaves best.  And not just the leaves of any eucalyptus tree. Of the more than seven hundred  varieties of eucalyptus, the koala will only eat from about three dozen of  them. [PAR] If you  are thinking that eucalyptus is highly nutritious because they are almost the  only food that koalas eat, you are wrong. The leaves of eucalyptus have little  protein, lots of material that is hard to digest, and are actually poisonous to  most animals. Bacteria in koala\u2019s stomach break down the poisonous oils in the  leaves so they do not harm the koala. [PAR] The koala must eat between 1 and 1.5 pound (454  and 680 grams) of eucalyptus leaves a day to provide it with enough nutrition  to survive. That is a lot to eat for a small animal. The koalas spend s about  two to four hours a night chewing the tough leaves into a thin paste that it  can swallow. When its stomach is full, it will store more leaves in its fat  cheeks. Much of the other eighteen or more hours of a koalas\u2019 day are spent  sleeping. All that eating is hard work, and the koala\u2019s poor diet provides it  with a limited amount of energy. [PAR] A change of Diet [PAR] As soon they are born they are fed on its  mother\u2019s milk. Shortly after its eyes open, it starts to eat \u201cpap\u201d. These are  special droppings produced by the mother, made from eucalyptus leaves she has  partly digested. The baby\u2019s stomach cannot digest fresh leaves, which are very  tough. But pap contains leaves that the mother\u2019s stomach has begun to break\n\n\n### Answer:\ngum tree </s>"}, {"instruction": "<s>### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.

Green had written a history of the city of Worcester, and had come to doubt previous descriptions of the tomb and its contents, among which was a long-standing contention that John had been buried elsewhere within the church. The effigy was removed first, followed by the slab on which it rested; inside the tomb chest, a stone coffin was discovered, containing the royal remains. The Dean and Chapter of Worcester Cathedral were immediately summoned, and inspection made of the King\u2019s body.

King John is most famous for agreeing to the Magna Carta, which was a charter of demands made by John's rebellious barons.

Both Saint Wulfstan and Saint Oswald can be seen in miniature beside the head of John on his effigy. [PAR] When John came to Worcester he would have stayed in the cathedral priory or castle.

Angostura\u00ae bitters was developed as a medication to treat hiccups and digestive problems, but is more often used today as an ingredient in baking and cooking, or as an ingredient in other alcoholic beverages. The recipe of Angostura\u00ae bitters continues to be one of the world's most guarded trade secrets. [PAR] In 1820, German medical doctor Johann Siegert moved to Venezuela in hopes of assisting Simon Bolivar to overthrow the Spanish rulers of the South American country. While developing a tonic was not Dr. Siegert's primary motivation for moving to Venezuela, he was concerned about the number of people who came down with severe fevers and stomach problems. These medical problems were having a negative impact on the revolution because so many soldiers became ill. By 1824, Dr. Siegert developed his \"Amargo Aromatico\" from tropical plants and herbs that he had located. The bitters was successful enough that the product began being exported to England and Trinidad in 1830. [PAR] Ad [PAR] Politics in Venezuela continued to be problematic.

Although the same Angostura\u00ae bitters recipe that Dr. Siegert developed is still in use and continues to be a secret, it is thought that as many as 40 ingredients or more are used to make the liquor. Some of the ingredients known to be in Angostura\u00ae include gentian root, cassia, and cinchona bark.  Angostura\u00ae bitters also has an alcoholic content of almost 45 percent. [PAR] Angostura\u00ae bitters can be used in a variety recipes from the beginning of a meal to the very last bite eaten. This bitters works particularly well with poultry. The bitters is often used in puddings for dessert. People also use Angostura\u00ae to spice Caribbean dishes. [PAR] People do not typically drink Angostura\u00ae alone. Angostura\u00ae bitters is more often an ingredient in other alcoholic beverages.

[PAR] This is not very often and makes it all the more difficult to successfully breed elephants in zoos. [PAR] Are there any outward signs? [PAR] An elephant cow shows no outward signs indicating that she is in heat. That is why it is important that the elephant cow and the elephant bull can meet freely for a few hours daily. [PAR] How often is an elephant cow covered by the elephant bull? [PAR] When an elephant cow has her oestrus, the bull covers her daily for 3 to 4 days. In a zoo, the bull should only be let in to the cows, however, when he is not in musth , as he can behave very unpredictably when this is the case.

Followers of the religion are called Rastafarians, Rastas, Dreads, Dreadlocks, Sufferers, or Locksmen. What started out as an entirely black-oriented religion spread throughout the world, particularly in the 1970s because of the popularity of reggae music, and currently has around one million followers in Japan, New Zealand, and elsewhere. [PAR] Rastafari History [PAR] Political leader Marcus Garvey made a prophecy that a king would be crowned in Africa and that king would redeem the black people. After Haile Selassie I became king of Ethiopia, Rastafari was established as a religion in Jamaica in the 1930s. The basis of the religion was to improve the condition of the black people. When Africa (which is known as Ethiopia by Rastafarians) was colonized by the Europeans, Africans were exiled to the rest of the world as slaves. Regions of captivation were called Babylon. According to Rastafari, Haile Selassie would save the blacks from the whites and return them to their home. In the 1970s, the popularity of reggae music and Bob Marley helped spread Rastafari. The new popularity alarmed traditional Rastafarians, who feared the commercialization of the religion. In 1973, the beliefs of Rastafari underwent a modern revision; they were revised again in 1991. In 1975, after being ousted, Haile Selassie died. [PAR] Rastafari Beliefs [PAR] According to Rastafari Haile Selassie is the only God. The chosen people of God are the blacks. Rastafari draws from many Old Testament laws and Rastafarians consider themselves the true Israelites. While some Rastafarians hold on to the traditional belief that blacks will one day suppress the whites, other Rastafarians believe in a modern multicultural society. Rastafari stresses the concept of the humanity of God and the divinity of humans, meaning that God can appear in the form of a human. The code of rules for woman and men differ in Rastafari. However, all Rastafarians believe in reincarnation and eternal life. The protect humanity and natural life. They oppose Paganism , contraception, and abortion. [PAR] Rastafari Customs [PAR] Rastafari is practiced in followers' homes or in a community center. It does not have a special building for communal worship, or reasoning sessions. These sessions include singing, praying, drumming, and chanting. Music is an important part of the rituals of Rastafari. Traditional music is called Nyabingi, which is a mix of African drum and 19th century gospel sounds. Rastafari also allows the ritual use of marijuana, which is believed to enhance spiritual responsiveness and is called holy herb or wisdom weed. Meditation is also part of Rasatafari worship. Most Rastafarians are vegetarians. Rastafarians are encouraged to follow strict diets of clean food and drinks like vegetables, fruit, and herbal tea. They must avoid alcohol, coffee, milk, meat and shellfish (especially pork), and fish that measure more than a foot long. Rastafarians are not allowed to use sharp instruments on human bodies; therefore, they are not allowed to cut hair, shave, tattoo, etc. As a result, Rastafarians grow their hair and twirl it into dreadlocks, symbolizing a lion's mane (the Rastafari symbol is the lion).[DOC] [TLE] Rastafari - College Essays - 1199 Words - StudyModeRastafari Essay - 1199 Words [PAR] 05 JAN 2011 [PAR] Rastafari [PAR] Rastafarian is not just a religion but a way of life.

The term has thus been applied as a name to the speech in its entirety.  It is considered a defining speech in Thatcher's political development,  becoming something of a Thatcherite motto.  [PAR] The phrase made reference to Thatcher's refusal to perform a \"U-turn\" in response to opposition to her liberalisation of the economy, which some commentators and Ted Heath had urged,  mainly because unemployment had risen to 2 million by the autumn of 1980 from 1.5 million the previous year and the economy was in recession,  exceeding 3 million by the time the recession ended in 1982.

[PAR] Excerpt[DOC] [TLE] United Kingdom general election, 1979The United Kingdom general election of 1979 was held on 3 May 1979 to elect 635 members to the British House of Commons.  The Conservative Party, led by Margaret Thatcher, ousted the incumbent Labour government of James Callaghan with a parliamentary majority of 44 seats.  The election was the first of four consecutive election victories for the Conservative Party, and Thatcher became the United Kingdom and Europe's first female elected head of government. [PAR] The previous parliamentary term had begun in October 1974, when Harold Wilson led Labour to a majority of three seats, but within 18 months he had resigned as prime minister to be succeeded by James Callaghan, and within a year the government's narrow parliamentary majority had gone.  Callaghan had made agreements with the Liberals, the Ulster Unionists, as well as the Scottish and Welsh nationalists in order to remain in power. However, on 28 March 1979 following the defeat of the Scottish devolution referendum, Thatcher tabled a motion of no confidence in James Callaghan's Labour government, which was passed by just one vote (311 to 310), triggering a general election five months before the end of the government's term. [PAR] The Labour campaign was hampered by the series of industrial disputes and strikes during the Winter of 1978-79, known as the Winter of Discontent and the party focused its campaign on support for the National Health Service and full employment. After intense media speculation, Callaghan had announced early in the autumn of 1978 that a general election would not take place that year having received private polling data which suggested a parliamentary majority was unlikely.  [PAR] The Conservative campaign employed the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi and pledged to control inflation as well as curbing the power of the trade unions.  The Liberal Party was damaged by allegations that its former leader Jeremy Thorpe had been involved in a homosexual affair, and had conspired to murder his former lover. [PAR] The Liberals were now being led by David Steel, meaning that all three major parties entered the election with a new leader. [PAR] The election saw a 5.2% swing from Labour to the Conservatives, the largest swing since the 1945 election, which Clement Attlee won for Labour.  Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister, and Callaghan was replaced as Labour leader by Michael Foot in 1980.  Results for the election were broadcast live on the BBC, and presented by David Dimbleby, Robert McKenzie, David Butler and Robin Day.   It was the first  general election to feature Rick Wakeman's song Arthur on the BBC's coverage.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence. [PAR] The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras). [PAR] On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.

Based on a true story, Anthony Mann directs this WWII diverting action adventure but with none of the distinction that earmarks his best films. A few years later, this kind of thing would be done better with WHERE EAGLES DARE.

To children he is best known as the arch-villain in the Robin Hood story, and in history he is remembered as \u2018bad king John\u2019, who lost most of the overseas possessions of the Angevin empire, irritated the barons so much that he was forced to sign the Magna Carta in 1215, and lost his Crown Jewels in the Wash. The legend of John\u2019s lost treasure has been handed down and grown in the telling for 700 years, largely by word of mouth, and anyone brought up in the Fens has heard it from an early age.\u00a0 [PAR] John was born on Christmas Eve, the youngest son of Henry II and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine. As a child, John tended to be overshadowed by is older brother Richard. Like his father, John developed a reputation for violent rages which lead to him foaming at the mouth. Henry left no land to John when he died so John was given the nick-name John Lackland. [PAR] In 1189, all of Henry's territory went to his oldest son, Richard I, better known as Richard the Lionheart. In 1199, Richard was killed in France and John became the king of England. His reign started in an unfortunate way. In 1202, John's nephew, Arthur of Brittany, was murdered. Many in Brittany believed that John was responsible for his murder and they rebelled against John. [PAR] In 1204, John's army was defeated in Brittany and John had no choice but to retreat. His military standing among the nobles fell and he was given a new nickname - John Softsword. The defeat in north France was a major blow for John and a costly one. To pay for the defeat, John increased taxes which was not popular with anybody other than John and his treasurers. John also succeeded in falling out with the pope in 1207. John quarreled with the pope over who should be Archbishop of Canterbury. The pope excommunicated John and put England under a Medieval Church law that stated that no christening or marriage would be legal until the time the pope said that they would be. Medieval Church law said that only christened people could get to Heaven while children born out of marriage were doomed to Hell. This placed people in England under a terrible strain and they blamed one person for this - John. [PAR] In 1213, John had to give in and surrender the spiritual well-being of the whole country to the pope. However, the pope never fully trusted John and in 1214, the pope proclaimed that anybody who tried to overthrow John would be legally entitled to do so. In the same year, John lost another battle to the French at Bouvines. This defeat resulted in England losing all her possessions in France. This was too much for the powerful barons in England. In 1214, they rebelled. John was forced to sign the Magna Carta at Runnymede in 1215. This guaranteed the people of England rights that the king could not go back on. In 1216, John tried to go back but this only provoked the barons into declaring war on him. By 1216, John was ill. During the war, he suffered from dysentery. [PAR] The basic story of his lost treasures, as related by historians from the 13th century onwards, is that King John was travelling in the East of England in late 1216. By the autumn of 1216, John\u2019s fortunes had sunk to a new low. He had inherited the mighty Angevin empire in England and France forged by his father Henry II, pawned to pay for the crusades by his brother Richard \u2013 and squandered by himself. Having already lost his lands in Normandy to the French king, he had faced a rampaging French army on his own soil aided and abetted by his own rebellious barons. The previous year he had been forced by them to sign the Magna Carta, reducing the powers of the crown.

By the time the next decade drew to a close, the world was going to hell in a hand basket out on the streets. Perhaps the singular characteristic of the era was that several new elements were introduced into the mystery mix over its course, including the perfect unbending TV cop for Richard Nixon\u2019s law-and-order regime. [PAR] The Defenders (1961-1965), while not solely a crime-oriented show, showed the power of the legal drama for confronting controversial issues. Car 54, Where Are You? (1961-1963) was the genre\u2019s first sitcom. The Saint (1963-1969 in various incarnations) introduced one of print\u2019s most enduring hero/rogues to TV. The Fugitive (1963-1967) showed how the classic man-on-the-run plotline was not only viable but compelling as it unfolded week after week on the small screen. The tension built up to one of the most-watched final shows in television history as Richard Kimball finally caught up with the man who had killed his wife. More an idea than a character in that he was not an active participant in the storyline until the final confrontation, \u201cthe one-armed man\u201d is one of TV\u2019s enduring villains. [PAR] I Spy (1965-1968) brought spies to the fore\u2013not to mention creating the medium\u2019s first African-American hero, some fella named Cosby. Then Mission: Impossible (1966-1973) made intricate weekly espionage assignments standard fare, offering challenges (\u201cYour mission, should you choose to accept it..\u201d) which the IMF team never turned down. Meanwhile, back in the less high tech world of the traditional lone wolf PI, Honey West (1965-1966) suggested that a pretty girl need not just stand daintily off to the side waiting for a man to get the job done. Then, just to keep the PI world in its proper perspective, Mannix (1967-1975), dour and effective, did the tried and true hard-boiled thing. [PAR] Ironside (1967-1975) became perhaps the best known of the many detectives over the years who refused to allow their physical handicaps to hinder the battle against crime. It also allowed Raymond Burr to separate himself from Perry Mason. The cultural war and youth revolution that was raging out in the real world did finally find expression of sorts in Mod Squad (1968-1973), featuring like, man, hip undercover operatives who would have left Joe Friday speechless. [PAR] The decade closed with the debut of what was TV\u2019s most controversial and, until Murder, She Wrote, longest-running crime drama, Hawaii 5-O (1968-1980). In a strange way, it probably reflected the argument that was tearing the country apart better than any other show. Fans debated whether the uncompromising attitude of Jack Lord\u2019s Steve McGarrett was a matter of high principle or right wing pseudo-fascism.

It was written by Irene Kuhn, Edgar Allan Woolf and John Willard based on the 1932 novel of the same name by Sax Rohmer. Starring Boris Karloff as Fu Manchu, and featuring Myrna Loy as his depraved daughter, the movie revolves around Fu Manchu's quest for the golden sword and mask of Genghis Khan. Lewis Stone plays his nemesis. [PAR] The Mask of Fu Manchu is considered the best of the Fu Manchu films produced in the 1930s. This is one of the few films produced by William Randolph Hearst's Cosmopolitan Productions which did not star Hearst's mistress, Marion Davies. [PAR] Plot [PAR] Sir Denis Nayland Smith (Lewis Stone) of the British Secret Service warns Egyptologist Sir Lionel Barton (Lawrence Grant) that he must beat Fu Manchu in the race to find the tomb of Genghis Khan. The power-mad Fu Manchu (Boris Karloff) intends to use the sword and mask to proclaim himself the reincarnation of the legendary conqueror and inflame the peoples of Asia and the Middle East into a war to wipe out the \"white race\". Sir Lionel is kidnapped soon afterward and taken to Fu Manchu. Fu Manchu tries bribing his captive, even offering his own daughter, Fah Lo See (Myrna Loy). When that fails, Barton suffers the \"torture of the bell\" (lying underneath a gigantic, constantly ringing bell) in an unsuccessful attempt to get him to reveal the location of the tomb. [PAR] Barton's daughter Sheila (Karen Morley) insists on taking her father's place on the expedition, as she knows where the tomb is. She finds the tomb and its treasures with the help of her fiance Terrence \"Terry\" Granville (Charles Starrett), Von Berg (Jean Hersholt), and McLeod (David Torrence). Nayland Smith joins them soon afterward. [PAR] McLeod is killed by one of Fu Manchu's men during a robbery attempt, after McLeod kills one of Fu Manchu's men. When that fails, an emissary offers to trade Barton for the priceless artifacts. Despite Terry's misgivings, Sheila persuades him to take the relics to Fu Manchu without Smith's knowledge. However, when Fu Manchu tests the sword, he determines that it is a fake (Nayland had switched them). Terry is whipped under the supervision of Fah Lo See, who is attracted to him. Meanwhile, Fu Manchu has Barton's corpse delivered to Sheila. When Nayland tries to rescue Terry, he is taken captive as well. [PAR] Terry is injected with a serum that makes him temporarily obedient to Fu Manchu and released. He tells Sheila and Von Berg that Nayland Smith wants them to bring the sword and mask to him. Sheila senses something is wrong, but Von Berg digs up the real relics, and they follow Terry into a trap. [PAR] Captured by Fu Manchu, the party is sentenced to death or enslavement, but not before Sheila manages to bring Terry back to his senses. Sheila is to become a human sacrifice, Nayland Smith is to be lowered into a crocodile pit, and Von Berg placed between two sets of metal spikes inching toward each other. Terry is prepared for another dose of the serum, which will make him a permanent slave of the whims of Fu Manchu's daughter. However, Nayland Smith manages to free himself, Terry, and Von Berg. Using one of Fu Manchu's own weapons\u2014a death ray that shoots an electric current\u2014the men incapacitate the arch-villain as he raises the sword to execute Sheila.  When Fu Manchu drops the sword, Terry picks it up and hacks him to death.  While Terry frees Sheila and carries her away, Nayland Smith and Von Berg incinerate Fu Manchu's followers using the same weapon. Safely aboard a ship bound for England, Nayland Smith tosses the sword over the side so that the world will be safe from any future Fu Manchu.

As this method gives the most points for gold medals, it most closely matches the ranking for the gold medal only system.

The head of the United Kingdom is the reigning King or Queen (currently Queen Elizabeth II), but the head of the government is the Prime Minister. Following the long held tradition, the Prime Minister of the UK lives at 10 Downing Street in London. Although the role is somewhat different, and has changed over the years, the Prime Minister is considered to be the British equivalent of the president of the United States. [PAR] Who was the first Prime Minister of Great Britain [PAR] Officially, the first Prime Minister of the United Kingdom was Sir Robert Walpole. He became the First Lord of the Treasury in 1721. Although the role of the Prime Minister has changed over the centuries, Sir Robert Walpole did have many of the same roles and duties as the current leader of parliament. He was also the first to live at 10 Downing Street, which was given to him as a gift from the King in 1735. He spent 20 years, 314 days in the position, which is still the record for the longest serving Prime Minister. Allegedly, he used bribery and corruption to retain power for so long. [PAR] Although the position of Prime Minister is now the most important in British politics, it was never originally created. In fact many of the first \u201cPrime Ministers\u201d refused to use the title to refer to themselves. The title of Prime Minister wasn\u2019t officially recognized until 1905 when it was added to the order of precedence. This is basically an ordered list of the most important people in the United Kingdom. [PAR] Related Articles[DOC] [TLE] Prime Minister of the United KingdomThe Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  is the head of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. The prime minister (informal abbreviation: PM) and Cabinet (consisting of all the most senior ministers, most of whom are government department heads) are collectively accountable for their policies and actions to the Monarch, to Parliament, to their political party and ultimately to the electorate. The , Theresa May, leader of the Conservative Party, was appointed by the Queen on 13 July 2016. [PAR] The office is not established by any constitution or law but exists only by long-established convention, which stipulates that the monarch must appoint as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons; this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber. The position of Prime Minister was not created; it evolved slowly and erratically over three hundred years due to numerous acts of Parliament, political developments, and accidents of history. The office is therefore best understood from a historical perspective. The origins of the position are found in constitutional changes that occurred during the Revolutionary Settlement (1688\u20131720) and the resulting shift of political power from the Sovereign to Parliament.  Although the Sovereign was not stripped of the ancient prerogative powers and legally remained the head of government, politically it gradually became necessary for him or her to govern through a Prime Minister who could command a majority in Parliament. [PAR] By the 1830s the Westminster system of government (or cabinet government) had emerged; the Prime Minister had become primus inter pares or the first among equals in the Cabinet and the head of government in the United Kingdom. The political position of Prime Minister was enhanced by the development of modern political parties, the introduction of mass communication (inexpensive newspapers, radio, television and the internet), and photography. By the start of the 20th century the modern premiership had emerged; the office had become the pre-eminent position in the constitutional hierarchy vis-\u00e0-vis the Sovereign, Parliament and Cabinet. [PAR] Prior to 1902, the prime minister sometimes came from the House of Lords, provided that his government could form a majority in the Commons.

[PAR] India [PAR] In India, an Advocate General is a legal adviser to a state government . The post is created by the Constitution of India and corresponds to that of Attorney General of India at the federal or central or union government level. [PAR] UK [PAR] Scotland [PAR] Historically, the United Kingdom Government was advised on matters of Scots Law by the Lord Advocate but following the Scotland Act 1998 and the establishment of the Scottish Parliament [PAR] the Lord Advocate became a member of the Scottish Executive . [PAR] It was necessary to create a post to advise the British Government in Westminster . Thus, the new post of Advocate General for Scotland was created. The Advocate General's role differs from that formerly held by the Lord Advocate in that they are only charged with advising the UK Government on matters pertaining to Scots law , the Lord Advocate having retained his responsibility as the chief public prosecutor in Scotland and head of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service on his transfer to the Scottish Executive. [PAR] Northern Ireland [PAR] The position of Advocate General for Northern Ireland is to be created following the devolution of policing and justice powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly .

They may also have a prosecution role, depending on countries and on the nature of cases (criminal or civil). [PAR] The position of Advocate General (avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) already existed in the French legal system before the French Revolution , when they were found in the then higher courts ( parlements , cours des aides , etc.) and proposed legal solutions to the judges in cases involving the State, the Church, the general public, communities, or minors. Since the French Revolution, they are found in the Supreme Court , the Court of Audit , the Courts of Appeal , and the Assize Courts . They have more of a prosecution role than before the French Revolution, especially in the Assize Courts, in which people accused of felonies are tried. [PAR] Advocates General are also part of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), where there are eight of them. The post is created by Article 222 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community (otherwise known as the Treaty of Rome ). They are full members of the court but they are not judges. They are not prosecutors either, unlike in the modern French legal system. They do not take part in the court 's deliberations, yet they assist with each case and deliver their opinions on questions. It is the role of the Advocates General to propose to the Court, in complete independence, a legal solution to the cases for which they are responsible.

Energy is generated by the sun, and is stored in a variety of forms. It is locked into biomass through the process of photosynthesis. Burning biomass releases energy, as does decomposing biomass (e.g., digesting it through anaerobic processes as in biogas ). Energy is stored in the oceans where the movement of the earth and gravity release it through tides, where the earth\u2019s movement and gravitational pull of the moon and sun generate tides, temperature variations and the earth\u2019s spin generate waves and wind. [PAR] Power is the flow of energy at any one time and is measured in Watts. Useful power is generated from renewable energy resources through solar conversion ( photovoltaics , solar thermal electricity, solar heating), through harnessing water ( hydropower for electricity, wave and tidal generation through turbines), through harnessing the wind ( wind pumps for water, wind turbines for electricity), and a variety of other energy sources. [PAR] Equipment and appliances are rated on a basis of Watts, and the amount of energy generated by equipment, or the amount consumed by equipment and appliances is measured in Watt-hours . The following terms and definitions provide further detail to the notion of power and energy. [PAR] Energy and Power Concepts [PAR] Energy [PAR] Energy is referred to as the ability to do work. Energy is measured in units called joules, J, or in watt hours as shown below. One kilojoule, kJ is equal to a thousand joules, and one megajoule, MJ, is equal to a million joules. [PAR] Watt hours (Wh), are a convenient way of measuring electrical energy. One watt hour is equal to a constant one watt supply of power supplied over one hour (3600 seconds). If a bulb is rated at 40watts, in one hour it will use 40 Wh, and in 8 hours it will use 320 Wh of energy. Electric power companies measure the amount of energy supplied to costumers in kilo [PAR] watt hours, Wh (or thousands of watt-hours, kWh). Note that one kilowatt hour (1kWh) is equal to 3.6 megajoules. [PAR] Power [PAR] Power is the rate at which energy is supplied (or energy per unit time). Power is measured in watts. One watt is equal to one joule supplied per second [PAR] SOME USEFUL ENERGY CONVERSIONS [PAR] Terms and definitions [PAR] \u00a0calorie : 4.1840 Joules (kilocalorie/kcal = 4.184 kilo Joules/kJ) [PAR] daily energy requirement: the amount of energy that a household, an institution, or any establishment requires to meet the sum total of its energy needs. Example: The daily energy requirement for a typical European household is approximately 45 kWh comprising demand from refrigerator, 20 light bulbs, a dishwasher, a washing machine, a clothes dryer, a TV, other household appliances. Typical energy requirements for an average East African rural household is on the order of less than 2 kWh comprising primarily heat energy (from biomass) for cooking, some kerosene for lighting. These estimates do not include the human power required to accomplish a number of tasks. [PAR] direct radiation: radiation coming in a beam from the sun which can be focused [PAR] efficiency: Efficiency is the percentage of power that gets converted to useful work. Example: An electric pump that is 60% efficient converts 60% of the input energy into work - pumping water. The remaining 40% becomes waste heat. [PAR] electricity: Energy that is generated by a number of forms, ranging from mechanical (e.g., wind mill), to thermal (e.g., diesel generator), to photovoltaic, and used to provide power for a number of applications.

Carpenter's Modern            British, Irish, and American Drama: A Descriptive Chronology, 1865-1965.            For an explanation of principles and limitations, click on Introduction above. [PAR] A selective            bibliography of books by and about the dramatist is appended. [PAR] 1888 [PAR] September [PAR] Thomas Stearns Eliot is born into a wealthy family on September 26 in St. Louis,    Missouri. His father, a successful businessman, and his mother, an activist    and frustrated poet, are both 45. [PAR] 1915 [PAR] Attending Oxford University, Eliot marries an Englishwoman and decides to make    England his home. [PAR] 1920 [PAR] May [PAR] In a review of a poetic drama by Middleton Murry, Eliot says that composing    such a drama in the present era \"is in fact the most difficult, the most    exhausting task that a poet can set himself\" (Athenaeum). [PAR] November [PAR] In \u201cThe Possibility of a Poetic Drama\u201d (Dial), Eliot    speculates why the poetic drama of the time is marked by \u201cincompetence.\u201d He doubts that \u201cany drama which \u2018embodies a philosophy\u2019 of    the author\u2019s (like Faust) or which illustrates a social theory    (like Bernard Shaw\u2019s) can possibly fulfil the requirements\u2014though    a place might be left for Shaw if not for Goethe.\u201d [PAR] 1924 [PAR] September [PAR] Arnold Bennett records in his diary that Eliot told him he \"wanted to write    a drama of modern life (furnished flat sort of people) in a rhythmic prose 'perhaps    with certain things in it accentuated by drum-beats.' \" [PAR] 1927 [PAR] Eliot converts to the Anglican faith, a radical divergence from his Unitarian    upbringing. [PAR] November [PAR] Eliot becomes a naturalized English citizen. One consequence is that although    he will continue to be regarded as an American poet, when his career in poetic    drama begins he is consistently treated as a British dramatist. [PAR] 1934 [PAR] May [PAR] Eliot\u2019s The Rock: A Pageant Play is staged at Sadler\u2019s    Wells Theatre 13 times to audiences of over a thousand per night. He had accepted    a commission from the Anglican diocese of London to supply the text (with others)    for a theatrical spectacle which would benefit the Forty-Five Churches Fund.    The episodic scenario which he was given to work with traces the history of    the English church from ancient to modern times in a production requiring 22    scene changes, an orchestra and choir, and a cast of 300. Its distinction as    one of many such fund-raising events lies in the memorable poetic speeches he    wrote for the choral narrator / commentator (later printed in his collections    of poetry). Eliot responds to detractors that the play was a \u201crevue and    an advertisement,\u201d not a contribution to dramatic literature; \"My    only serious dramatic aim was to show that there is a possible role for a chorus\" (June Spectator).

In many languages there is a technical term such as pyrosis and a popular term for the same phenomenon. For example, pyrosis is popularly known in French as br\ufffdlure epigastrique and in Spanish as ardor de est\ufffdmago. Pyrosis is the Greek word meaning burning. [PAR] Last Editorial Review: 6/14/2012[DOC] [TLE] Alternative Medicines for Heartburn | HowStuffWorksAlternative Medicines for Heartburn | HowStuffWorks [PAR] Alternative Medicines for Heartburn [PAR] NEXT PAGENEXT\u00a0\u00a0 [PAR] Heartburn is the burning sensation that results when acidic juices travel from the stomach up the esophagus. The technical term is acid reflux. It's usually caused by overindulging in food or alcohol, or by stress, but physical conditions such as hiatal hernia can also produce the symptom. [PAR] Herbal Medicine for Heartburn [PAR] Herbs can improve digestion and soothe the stomach. One commonly used herb is ginger. Fresh gingerroot is used to absorb the acid in stomach juices and can calm upset stomachs. [PAR] Up Next [PAR] Amazing Alternative Medicine Pictures [PAR] Although it sounds paradoxical, one of the most common causes of heartburn is not enough stomach acid. With less acid to aid in the breakdown process, food stays undigested in the stomach longer, thus increasing the chances of reflux. The group of herbs known as bitters signals the stomach to crank out more digestive juices. The herbs' bitter taste on the tongue is probably responsible for sending these messages to the brain and stomach. Bitters include gentian root, dandelion root, wormwood, and goldenseal root. [PAR] Carminatives, another group of herbs, can relieve stomach discomforts as well as gas. They include fennel seeds, lemon balm leaves, and peppermint leaves and stems. [PAR] The leaves and stems of meadowsweet can also pamper an irritated digestive tract. Meadowsweet protects and soothes mucous membranes and reduces excess acidity. The tincture form can be more palatable than teas, and for those who find alcohol irritating, the tincture can be put in hot water to evaporate the alcohol. [PAR] An herbalist may prescribe drinking a tea of gentian root about half an hour before a meal to prevent heartburn. Prepare the tea by simmering about a teaspoon of the chopped, dried root in a cup of water for 20 minutes. If the taste of the gentian root tea is too bitter, capsules are also effective. [PAR] Biofeedback Training for Heartburn [PAR] Biofeedback training has shown promise in several digestive disorders, including heartburn. It can teach people with heartburn to control the action of their digestive systems as well as to reduce stress, thereby preventing the pain. Here's how it might work: [PAR] The patient's abdomen, head, or other body part is hooked up to a biofeedback machine with sensors that measure unconscious bodily functions and give back readings (either visual signs or audible tones). This information lets the patient know which functions need to be controlled or relaxed. [PAR] The biofeedback technician teaches techniques such as creative visualization, giving the patient ways to alter the bodily functions. [PAR] After weeks of practice, the machines are no longer needed, and the patient can reinforce the lessons with techniques at home. [PAR] A biofeedback technician can perform biofeedback training after your health care practitioner has ruled out other, more serious digestive problems. A therapeutic course can last as long as four months. [PAR] Traditional Chinese Medicine for Heartburn [PAR] According to traditional Chinese medicine, heartburn reveals an imbalance in the body's energy, or qi, and a disruption of the harmony between the body's opposing forces (yin and yang). For example, the painful, burning sensation may signal that the energy is blocked and that the stomach system has too much yang. The following therapies can offer relief: [PAR] Acupuncture and acupressure -- using needles or pressure points to clear the energy channels or strengthen or calm the energy. One acupressure treatment for heartburn might be, for example, to find a specific point near the ankle joint, then press the thumb on that spot.

[PAR] Shashlik (\u0428\u0430\u0448\u043b\u044b\u043a) is a type of shish kebab commonly found in Russia and the former Soviet republics.  It was likely brought to Moscow from Central Asia in the 19th century.  Today, it\u2019s a popular summer food cooked over an open fire at social gatherings.  It\u2019s traditionally prepared with lamb, but chicken, pork, and beef variations are becoming increasingly prominent.  With summer in full swing throughout the country right now, I thought it would be a great time to share this tasty dish! [PAR] There are a few tricks that I came up with when developing this recipe that I think are pretty sweet.  While the dish is traditionally marinated in either vinegar or lemon juice, I found that the combination of lemon juice and apple cider vinegar gives the meat a tangy and subtly sweet flavor.  Secondly, leaving the salt out of the marinade and saving it for the last stage of the recipe provides for a really great complementary texture to the tender and juicy meat. [PAR] You\u2019ll Need: [PAR] 1/2 lamb shoulder (2 lbs) [PAR] 2 medium onions, blended [PAR] 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar [PAR] 1/4 cup water [PAR] juice of 1/2 lemon (2 tsp) [PAR] 1 tbsp black pepper [PAR] 1 tbsp oregano [PAR] 1 tsp sea salt [PAR] I had my eye on this beautifully-marbled lamb shoulder from Lava Lake Lamb for a while now, and it was the perfect cut of meat for this dish.

[PAR] Don\u2019t forget that I\u2019m giving away a $100 Lava Lake Lamb gift card this week; it\u2019s easy to enter!  See here for details. [PAR] Cut the lamb into 2\u2033 chunks, and place in a ziploc bag. [PAR] In a blender or food processor, blend the onion, garlic, and water.  Combine with the bay leaves, apple cider vinegar, pepper, oregano, and lemon juice and pour everything into the ziploc bag.  Marinate in the fridge for four hours. [PAR] After four hours, skewer the lamb pieces (if using wooden skewers, soak them for 30 minutes first) and warm up your grill on med/high heat. [PAR] Grill on direct heat, rotating the skewers with a pair of tongs every few minutes, and sprinkle the salt over the skewers as they cook. [PAR] When you have a hard time looking at the skewers because they are so delicious, remove them from the grill.  Should take about 10 minutes altogether.
